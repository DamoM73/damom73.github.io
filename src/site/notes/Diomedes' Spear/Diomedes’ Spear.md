_A Campaign for The Expanse RPG_

**“The Belt bleeds, and the Inners sip champagne on Titan.”**

Six months have passed since Eros burned across the system and plunged into Venus. The stars haven’t looked right since.

The UN and the MCRN point guns at each other while retreating from their outposts in the Belt, leaving behind a power vacuum—and an opportunity. On Ceres, Anderson Dawes is calling for Belters to stand for themselves, to protect their own from pirates, criminals, and the vultures that circle in corporate suits.

You are a crew of freelancers, survivors, and exiles drawn into a fragile alliance under Dawes’ watchful eye. You’ve been asked to do what the Inners never would: look after your own. Enforce justice in a place where the laws are written in dust. You’ll root out smugglers, uncover hidden agendas, and tangle with black-budget ghosts that should have stayed buried.

And somewhere in the dark, something is stirring—something colder than vacuum, and older than Mars.

This is _Diomedes’ Spear_—a story of loyalty, betrayal, and survival in a solar system coming apart at the seams.

**Buckle in, Beltawala. Time to choose who you bleed for.**
