> The Martian Congressional Republic Navy always puts its best foot forward with design and technology, and this state-of-the-art dropship is no different. The only dropship to be mounted with ground-focused artillery, the Troika class dropship can set down on any battlefield and provide heavy fire while Marines pour out of it.
