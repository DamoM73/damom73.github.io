> [!info] Description
> Named after Harrison Schmitt, the first professional scientist to leave low Earth orbit and to visit the moon, this ship is designed for manoeuvring in close proximity to asteroids to take the necessary tests and even perform small-scale mining operations. It is small and agile, while still being large enough to carry a crew along with a large quantity of scientific instrumentation. It is also capable of capturing and hauling smaller asteroids. Although popular among independent operators, this ship is often used by the UN and MCR.
