> [!info] Description
> Space combat can be notoriously dangerous and lethal, and stations experience medical catastrophes such as disease outbreaks or even the occasional asteroid strike. Itâ€™s times like these when the Peseshet-class medical support ship comes into play. Most of these ships are owned by non-profit medical relief groups dedicated to wellness; however, the UNN also uses this class of ship as a medical support frigate.
