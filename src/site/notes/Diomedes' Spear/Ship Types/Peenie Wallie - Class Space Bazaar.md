> [!info] Description
> Born from an open-source project for an affordable mid sized transport, the current widely-accepted design for Peenie Wallie freighters has been touched by professional and amateur shipwrights across the Belt. With their reliance on prefabricated components and baked-in versatility for bulk goods and specialty transportation, Peenie Wallies are often used as a roving marketplace, moseying from port to port in the Belt and serving up trinkets, foodstuffs, and entertainment for mining operations, manufacturers, and settlements.
