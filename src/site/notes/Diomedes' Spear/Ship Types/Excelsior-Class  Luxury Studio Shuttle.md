> [!info] Description
> the Excelsior-class stands out as a tribute to a special sort of opulence. Marketed as the ultimate vessel for celebrities and entertainers on the go, this “shuttle”—and that term is used with a great deal of irony by the Trayce Extrasolar Builders marketing depart ment considering the ship’s size—combines the personal comfort of a yacht and the professional polish of a high end creative suite, complete with advanced recording and editing facilities, allowing the beautiful and famous to travel the stars while not suffering a drop in content quality. Add in a large party space for entertaining friends and faithful and what more could an interstellar celebrity ask for?
