> [!info] Description
> Designed to remain in a target area for an extended period, the Beta class is technically a ship but functions as a mobile scouting platform: a base of operations for a team of scouts to perform detailed mapping of a large space. It carries two shut tles, which are typically used to either “divide and conquer” the area or to closely focus on a special area of interest while the rest of the team continues the general mission.
