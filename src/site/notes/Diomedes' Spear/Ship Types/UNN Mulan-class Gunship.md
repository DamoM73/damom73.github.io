> [!info] Description
The Mulan-class gunship isn’t just the smallest ship in the United Nations Navy fleet, but it is the smallest combat ready ship in the system, which is efficient for the UN since it only requires four crew to fully outfit.

| Agile                   | Makes the vessel extremely nimble, granting a +1 bonus (up to +3) to Evasion tests and other Piloting tests requiring manoeuvrability.                                                                                                                                                                                            | Only available for Small or Medium ships. Must be built-in. [i, 489]                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Yes (up to +3, e.g., Agile II, Agile III)                                                                           |
| Redundant Hull (Double) | Provides a redundant barrier, allowing the ship to ignore the first loss condition imposed in an encounter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | None stated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | No                                                                                                                  |
| Hull Plating            | Provides a +1 bonus when determining the ship's Hull total against damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | None stated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Yes, up to a maximum equal to the Hull score in dice (e.g., Hull Plating II, III, V)                                |
| Manoeuvrable            | The ship is fast and nimble, treated as one Size category smaller for manoeuvring tests (changing range, evading attacks, chases), granting a +1 bonus to such tests.                                                                                                                                                             | None stated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Yes (can be Highly Manoeuvrable with two qualities; e.g., Manoeuvrable II)                                          |
| Limited Range           | The ship does not carry enough reaction mass for long-distance travel using its Epstein drive. It is limited to short trips (e.g., between a planet and moon or station to station), with a typical range of about 1 AU. It also limits the ship’s speed to up to 1g and takes a considerable amount of time to reach this speed. | The ship is not equipped with an Epstein drive, or it has insufficient reaction mass. Applies to Insertion-type Dropship Skiff, Marauder-type Dropship Skiff, and Mulan-class Gunship.                                                                               | Not applicable, as it describes a fundamental limitation of the ship's drive system rather than a variable penalty. |
| Poor Amenities          | The ship’s living quarters and other amenities are of poor quality. This causes Recovering activities on board to take 50% longer.                                                                                                                                                                                                | Commonly found on older or poorly maintained shuttles and other vessels. Also noted on Asp-class, Mulan-class, Murphy-class, Phantom-class, Morgaina-class, Tereshkova-type, Windrose L6 Vayu, Loki, Lopt, UNN Sinclair, Drosera Capensis, Shu-class, and Cassandra. | Not explicitly stated as stackable.                                                                                 |
| Aging                   | The ship is getting older and requires extra work to remain at peak performance. This necessitates additional Maintenance, Researching, and/or Fixing activities during interludes and increases the Resupply Cost by +1 to cover additional minor upkeep materials.                                                              | Applies to ships that are generally old.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Not explicitly stated as stackable.                                                                                 |
