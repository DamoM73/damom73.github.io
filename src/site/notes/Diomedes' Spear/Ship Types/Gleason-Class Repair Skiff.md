> [!info] Description
> The Gleason-type repair skiff isnâ€™t like typical spaceships, instead resembling terrestrial vehicles in size and function except for their thrusters and capabilities of operating in different gravities. They typically have room for only a pilot and a small quantity of materials, with mechanical arms equipped with various tools that can help the ship perform different tasks.
