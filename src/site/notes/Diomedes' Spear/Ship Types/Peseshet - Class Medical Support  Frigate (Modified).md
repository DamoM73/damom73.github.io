> [!info] Description
> Medical ships are large, contain lots of free space, and are specifically designed for boarding damaged vessels. Pirates have discovered that instead of helping and housing the wounded, medical ships also make a dandy way to capture prize ships and their cargo. Despite their size, medical ships run on a small crew and usually contain state-of-the-art systems—all the better for tracking and disabling a prize.
