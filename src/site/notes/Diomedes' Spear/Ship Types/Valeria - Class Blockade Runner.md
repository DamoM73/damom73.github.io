> [!info] Description
> Built tough and fast, Valeria-class ships were designed at the Bush Naval Shipyards to punch through defensive lines and deposit their cargo quicklyâ€”whether that cargo involves supplies, munitions, or soldiers. These ships were intended to be attached to capital ships as support vessels during a space station or moon invasion, but with their Epstein drive, they can also be used to deliver goods behind enemy lines in distant theatres away from larger f leet actions.
