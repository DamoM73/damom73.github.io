> [!info] Description
> This class of pirate ship was born of the reasoning that, if you’re going to board a freighter and take its cargo, what better place to put it than another freighter? Small freighters like these number in the thousands just in the solar system itself, and they’re easy to modify and outfit with weapons—sometimes lots of weapons—and other piratical improvements.
