> [!info] Description
> This modified shuttle replaces cargo capacity with space for up to eight small (even by ship standards) cells for trans porting prisoners, up to 16 cells, if both cargo decks are given over to it, but that’s rare, since LaBrea’s will also be used to transport cargo or materials to their destination as well as prisoners.
