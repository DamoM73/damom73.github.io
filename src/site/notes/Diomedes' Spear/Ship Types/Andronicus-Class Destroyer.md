| Rail Gun, High-Charged          | These rail guns fire slugs with higher thrust, rerolling 1s or 2s rolled for damage until the result is 3-6.                                                                                  | Requires a Rail Gun quality.                  | No                                                                                   |
| Hull Plating                    | Provides a +1 bonus when determining the ship's Hull total against damage.                                                                                                                    | None stated.                                  | Yes, up to a maximum equal to the Hull score in dice (e.g., Hull Plating II, III, V) |
| Acceleration, Improved          | Allows the ship to accelerate faster, granting up to a +7 bonus (or +9 with additional applications) on high-g manoeuvres, and a +1 bonus (up to +3) on Piloting tests to change range.       | None stated.                                  | Yes (up to +9 / +3)                                                                  |
| Medical Expert System           | The ship includes advanced medical facilities, such as auto-docs, allowing users to provide medical care.                                                                                     | None stated.                                  | No                                                                                   |
| Plasma Torpedoes                | These torpedoes inflict focused damage; when a 1 or 2 is rolled for damage, it is rerolled until the result is 3-6 (or treated as a 3 in a revised rule). [i, 255, 490]                       | Requires a Torpedo Launcher quality. [i, 255] | No                                                                                   |
| Rapid Reload Torpedo Tubes      | Reduces the SP cost to use the Rapid Reload Command Stunt by 1.                                                                                                                               | None stated.                                  | No                                                                                   |
| Redundant Hull (Double)         | Provides a redundant barrier, allowing the ship to ignore the first loss condition imposed in an encounter.                                                                                   | None stated.                                  | No                                                                                   |
| Sensor Scrambling               | When an enemy is within Medium or closer range, they suffer a -1 penalty to all Sensors tests.                                                                                                | None stated.                                  | No                                                                                   |
| Self-Destruct System            | An onboard system that can be programmed to overload the fusion reactor, annihilating the ship and its contents. [i, 255]                                                                     | None stated.                                  | No                                                                                   |
