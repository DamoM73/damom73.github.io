> [!info] Description
> The Martian Corvette-class light frigate is a popular choice among pirate crews who manage to acquire one. They’re fast, maneuverable, have a decent amount of cargo space, and can be upgraded easily. They’re built at the Callisto shipyards but can be found on patrol and military operations throughout the solar system.
