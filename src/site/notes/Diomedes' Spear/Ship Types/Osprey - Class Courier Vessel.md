> [!info] Description
> Commissioned by the MCRN to act as go-betweens on capital ships in active theatres, Osprey-class vessels are small, maneuverable, and operate more like a racing pinnace than a military vessel. Because they’ve been out of service for decades, having been replaced with newer designs, it’s not uncommon to find refitted or modified Osprey-class vessels acting as fast-delivery couriers in the Jovian and Saturnian systems.
