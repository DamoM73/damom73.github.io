> [!info] Description
> Tycho Corp designed the Cronkite-class for their fledgling news agency (Tycho News), which never took off. However, since they already designed new tech for the ships, and several keels laid and construction on the out hulls near completion, Tycho decided to complete the run of ships and put them on the market. It turned out that they were more popular than anticipated, so production has continued.
