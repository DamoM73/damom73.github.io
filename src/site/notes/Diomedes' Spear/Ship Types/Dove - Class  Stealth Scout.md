> [!info] Description
> The Dove class is a considerable step up from the Mosquito class—some scouts would say the addition of a coffee maker alone achieves that feat, but the class also features two decks, more generous crash couches, and an actual toilet. This two-person class excels at stealth operations; while it can’t compete with military stealth ships, it is effective at performing long-range observations while not being observed in return
