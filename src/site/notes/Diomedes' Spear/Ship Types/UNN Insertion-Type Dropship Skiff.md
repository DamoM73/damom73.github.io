> [!info] Description
> Much larger than their utility and maintenance brethren, dropship skiffs are meant to transport officers and soldiers to the ground or from ship-to-ship. The Insertion-type (also called I-type) dropship skiff is the smaller of the two dropships and is hosted in the hangar bays of the Truman-class dreadnoughts used by the United Nations Navy.
