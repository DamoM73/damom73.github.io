> [!info] Description
> Much larger than their utility and maintenance brethren, dropship skiffs are meant to transport officers and soldiers to the ground or from ship-to-ship. The Insertion-type (also called I-type) dropship skiff is the smaller of the two dropships and is hosted in the hangar bays of the Truman-class dreadnoughts used by the United Nations Navy.

| Manoeuvrable  | The ship is fast and nimble, treated as one Size category smaller for manoeuvring tests (changing range, evading attacks, chases), granting a +1 bonus to such tests.                                                                                                                                                             | None stated.                                                                                                                                                                           | Yes (can be Highly Manoeuvrable with two qualities; e.g., Manoeuvrable II)                                          |
| Hull Plating  | Provides a +1 bonus when determining the ship's Hull total against damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | None stated.                                                                                                                                                                           | Yes, up to a maximum equal to the Hull score in dice (e.g., Hull Plating II, III, V)                                |
| Limited Range | The ship does not carry enough reaction mass for long-distance travel using its Epstein drive. It is limited to short trips (e.g., between a planet and moon or station to station), with a typical range of about 1 AU. It also limits the shipâ€™s speed to up to 1g and takes a considerable amount of time to reach this speed. | The ship is not equipped with an Epstein drive, or it has insufficient reaction mass. Applies to Insertion-type Dropship Skiff, Marauder-type Dropship Skiff, and Mulan-class Gunship. | Not applicable, as it describes a fundamental limitation of the ship's drive system rather than a variable penalty. |
