| Hangar Bay                | The ship has a hangar capable of carrying ships three or more Size categories smaller, and includes necessary maintenance equipment for them.                                                                 | None stated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Yes (capacity increases with size, e.g., for three Troika-class dropships) |
| Improved Stores           | The ship can stock supplies for extended travel for its crew and half its optimal crew listing (or more passengers).                                                                                          | None stated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | No                                                                         |
| Medical Expert System     | The ship includes advanced medical facilities, such as auto-docs, allowing users to provide medical care.                                                                                                     | None stated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | No                                                                         |
| Reduced Crew Requirements | Optimised controls allow the ship to be manned by a smaller crew, halving the usual requirement (minimum 1).                                                                                                  | None stated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | No                                                                         |
| Sturdy                    | The ship is well-built and can take more damage than expected, receiving a +2 bonus to its Hull value.                                                                                                        | Must be built-in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | No                                                                         |
| Lumbering                 | The ship is considered one Size category larger than its actual Size when it comes to maneuvering tests to change range, evade attacks, and for chases. This typically results in a â€“1 penalty to such tests. | Excelsior-class ships can be Lumbering due to their emphasis on comfort over precise maneuvering. Also applies to Munroe-class Light Destroyer, Xerxes-class Battleship, LDS Nauvoo, Prinzessin Victoria Luise, and Beta-class Scouting Platform. | Not explicitly stated as stackable.                                        |
