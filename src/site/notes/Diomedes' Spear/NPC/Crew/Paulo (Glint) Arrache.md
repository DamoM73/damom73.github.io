## Background
- Glint lives like a ghost behind a rusted hatch beneath Dome 6. His workshop, patched together with repurposed server racks and scavenged drone arms, is a haven for Belters needing air seals, heat sinks, or weapons off the books.
- He doesn’t advertise. Doesn’t explain. If you know where to knock, you get what you need.
- Sometimes, Havoc shows up. They don’t talk about the past. Just trade looks. Maybe a bottle. Sometimes Glint gives him hardware; sometimes Havoc drops an envelope of scrip and leaves without a word. The connection remains. Scarred. Muted. Unbreakable.
