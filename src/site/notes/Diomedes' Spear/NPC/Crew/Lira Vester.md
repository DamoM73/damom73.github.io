## Background
- Worked for Protogen as a geneticist.
- Warned by her lover (a technician) that her upcoming promotion would result in her undergoing neurological cauterization.
- Fled Protogen when her lover went missing and no one was even acknowledged he even existed.
- Used a cache of stolen credentials and her private funds, she hopped transports across the Belt, avoiding security scans and biometric checks.
- At Ceres she saw a former colleague [[Diomedes' Spear/NPC/Ceres/Dr Donald Hanson\|Dr Donald Hanson]] at a distance and was convinced he recognised her. So she attempted to escape further, she used her remaining funds bribing a dock worker to slip aboard a cargo hauler bound for Pallas Station â€” _The Slow Dog_.
