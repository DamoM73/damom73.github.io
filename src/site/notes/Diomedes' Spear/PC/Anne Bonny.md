| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Atmosphere Capable        | The ship can operate and land in a planetary atmosphere for limited periods.                                                                                                                                                    | Must be built-in. [i, 489] | No                                                                                   |
| Hidden Compartments       | Designed for smuggling or concealing cargo from inspections.                                                                                                                                                                    | None stated.               | Yes, by implication (e.g., Bullfrog's "Nooks and Crannies" enhances this)            |
| Acceleration, Improved    | Allows the ship to accelerate faster, granting up to a +7 bonus (or +9 with additional applications) on high-g manoeuvres, and a +1 bonus (up to +3) on Piloting tests to change range.                                         | None stated.               | Yes (up to +9 / +3)                                                                  |
| Improved Stores           | The ship can stock supplies for extended travel for its crew and half its optimal crew listing (or more passengers).                                                                                                            | None stated.               | No                                                                                   |
| Hull Plating              | Provides a +1 bonus when determining the ship's Hull total against damage.                                                                                                                                                      | None stated.               | Yes, up to a maximum equal to the Hull score in dice (e.g., Hull Plating II, III, V) |
| Medical Expert System     | The ship includes advanced medical facilities, such as auto-docs, allowing users to provide medical care.                                                                                                                       | None stated.               | No                                                                                   |
| Reduced Crew Requirements | Optimised controls allow the ship to be manned by a smaller crew, halving the usual requirement (minimum 1).                                                                                                                    | None stated.               | No                                                                                   |
| Redundant Hull (Double)   | Provides a redundant barrier, allowing the ship to ignore the first loss condition imposed in an `1encounter.                                                                                                                   | None stated.               | No                                                                                   |
| High Maintenance          | The ship is difficult to maintain and requires significant care to remain operational. The GM should require additional Maintenance activities during interludes and increase the Lifestyle Cost of maintaining the ship by +1. | None stated.               | Not explicitly stated as stackable.                                                  |
