You see, the Eros Incident is not merely a historical event; it is a _biblical_ event in its essence. It is an unveiling of the fallen nature of man—the hubris, the sin, and the inevitable suffering that follows when we abandon the Logos, the divine order, in favour of our own twisted ambitions. This is Cain slaying Abel on a planetary scale. This is the Tower of Babel, not just reaching to the heavens, but _penetrating_ into the unknown depths of creation where man was never meant to tread.

What happened on Eros was _sacrificial_—but not in the way that Christ was sacrificed for the redemption of mankind. This was the inversion of sacrifice. Instead of offering oneself in obedience to truth, the powerful offered the weak in obedience to ambition. This is the core of tyranny, the corruption that seeps into human institutions when they believe they can _create_ meaning and _define_ morality, rather than submit to the moral structure already present in the fabric of the universe.

And we must ask: _why_ did this happen? Why did Protogen, a corporation run by men and women like you and me—educated, strategic, ambitious—why did they _choose_ to commit such a crime? It wasn’t mere greed. No, no, it was something much deeper.

It was the same temptation that lurked in the Garden. It was the Serpent’s whisper: _You shall be as gods._

That’s the lie that has seduced humanity since the beginning. The idea that we can redefine the cosmos on _our_ terms, that we can _transcend_ our limitations, that we can master forces beyond our understanding. And what did it lead to? The creation of a _new_ god—a terrible, mindless god, consuming and reshaping everything in its image. This is the birth of an abomination, a golden calf made not of metal, but of suffering, flesh, and alien horror.

And this is what people _don’t_ understand about the moral structure of reality. We like to think we can dabble in the unknown, that we can grasp knowledge and _own_ it, like it’s a commodity. But the Bible tells us something very different. It tells us that knowledge is _dangerous_. That without wisdom, without morality, knowledge doesn’t _free_ you—it _enslaves_ you. That’s what the Fall was about! Adam and Eve took the fruit, not because they were starving, not because they were in need, but because they _wanted to know_, they wanted to decide for _themselves_ what was right and wrong.

Protogen did the exact same thing. They found something beyond human comprehension, and instead of approaching it with humility, instead of treating it as sacred, they decided to _use_ it. To _own_ it. To _control_ it.

And look what happened.

A plague upon a people who had no say in their own fate. The Belters were _sacrificed_ to this new god of science without morality. But that’s always how these things go. The powerful never offer _themselves_. They don’t take up the Cross. They make others carry it for them. And that, my friends, is not just evil—it is _satanic_.

Now, consider what followed. Eros _moved_. Eros _thought_. It was no longer just a station; it became something _else_. And this is where we enter truly biblical territory. Because Eros, as it fell into the grip of the protomolecule, became a city of the damned.

Think of the story of Sodom and Gomorrah. A city so steeped in sin, in corruption, that it had to be destroyed—not just because the people were wicked, but because the _city itself_ had become an abomination. The Eros Incident is the same story, told again, in the language of science fiction. The entire station became _possessed_, if you will, by an alien force that twisted everything it touched. And once it started moving toward Earth, it was no longer just a tragedy—it was an _apocalypse_.

And that’s the warning here. That’s the _moral_ of this catastrophe.

We think we are the masters of creation. We think we are the builders of Babel, the rulers of our own destiny. But the moment we sever our knowledge from divine wisdom, the moment we try to wrestle control of the universe away from God, we don’t _gain_ power. We _unleash_ it. And once it is unleashed, it does _not_ serve us—it _devours_ us.

Eros was a lesson. It was a demonstration of what happens when humanity plays at divinity. And what was the result? The whole world stood at the edge of annihilation, because a handful of people thought they could reach beyond what was rightfully theirs.

So what do we learn from this?

First, that suffering is the inevitable result of knowledge without wisdom. That is why scripture constantly warns us about arrogance. ‘Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.’ And what is Eros but the _fall_? A world plunged into chaos because of the pride of a few.

Second, we learn that power is never neutral. You cannot separate knowledge from morality. The idea that science is ‘just science,’ that progress is _always_ good—this is an illusion. The world doesn’t work that way. The only thing that prevents _every_ scientific breakthrough from turning into another Eros is _moral restraint_.

And third, and perhaps most importantly, we learn that there are forces in this universe beyond our comprehension, and we would be wise to _fear_ them. Whether you call it the protomolecule, the abyss, or something else, the lesson is the same: _Some doors are not meant to be opened._

So what do we do?

We _repent_. We recognize our limitations. We do not abandon knowledge, but we subordinate it to something _higher_. The way forward is not the reckless pursuit of power. The way forward is the _Logos_, the divine order, the wisdom that comes from humility before God.

Because if we don’t learn this lesson—if we keep pretending that we are gods—then we will see another Eros.

And next time, we might not survive it."
