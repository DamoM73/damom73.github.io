"Okay, folks, we’re talking about Eros. Terrible thing. Just _terrible_. A total disaster. Maybe one of the worst disasters in human history. And let me tell you, nobody saw this coming—well, except me. I _would_ have seen it coming.

Because here’s the thing—what happened on Eros? It should _never_ have happened. _Never._ But you had these weak, weak leaders. Weak politicians, weak scientists, and—most importantly—weak corporations, and they let this _horrible thing_ happen. And now, look at it—Eros, a total mess. It’s floating around, glowing blue, making everybody very, very nervous. And frankly, it’s not good. It’s very bad.

Now, I’m a businessman, okay? I know deals. I’ve made _incredible_ deals. And let me tell you something—Protogen? Bad deal. Very bad deal. What they did—unbelievable. They take this alien goo, right? This, uh, what do they call it? The _proto_—whatever. And they decide, ‘Hey, let’s just dump it on a bunch of Belters, see what happens.’ Disgusting! _Disgusting!_ And now, all these people are—let’s be honest—_melted_. They’re blue and glowing and floating around, and it’s not good.

And where was the UN? Where was Mars? Nowhere! Nowhere to be found. They were sitting around, making _bad_ decisions, probably giving out more free healthcare or something—very sad. Meanwhile, Eros is getting taken over by this _thing_, and suddenly, it’s moving. Can you believe that? _Moving_. They said, ‘Oh, it can’t move,’ and then—boom!—it moves! That’s the kind of thing we should’ve stopped _before_ it happened. But no one listened to the smart people—like me.

Now, let me tell you what _I_ would have done. First of all, folks, let’s be real—we would have had _the best_ space security. Absolutely _the best_. I would’ve built an _incredible_ defence system. A _tremendous_ defence system. Some people are saying—many people are saying—it would have been the _greatest_ defence system.

And you know what? We wouldn’t have let this happen. We would’ve been tough. We would’ve been smart. We would’ve said, ‘Hey, Protogen, you wanna play games with alien goo? Not happening. Not on my watch.’ We’d hit ‘em with sanctions—_big_ sanctions. I do the _best_ sanctions, believe me. And if they didn’t stop? _Boom!_ We shut them down. Totally shut them down.

And another thing—I like Belters, okay? _Some_ Belters, great people. Hardworking people. But let’s be honest, folks, the Belt has a _lot_ of problems. _A lot_ of problems. Crime, corruption—terrible. And what did the UN do? Nothing. They let this happen. Meanwhile, we’ve got people out there, good people, hard-working people, trying to make an honest living—and suddenly, their space station is crawling with blue glowy zombies. Not good! Not good at all.

Now, let me tell you what we _should_ be doing. First, we get tough on corporations that do _very bad things_—like Protogen. We hold them _accountable_. We _win_. Second, we _protect_ our people—Inner, Outer, doesn’t matter. If you’re human, we protect you. And third? We make sure this _never_ happens again. We put up a _big_, _beautiful_ defence system around Medina Station, around Ceres. A _huge_ shield. And I know shields, folks. I do _great_ shields. We stop alien goo _before_ it spreads.

And let me say this, because it’s very important—people are asking, ‘Mr. Trump, do you think this was an invasion? Do you think the aliens are coming?’ And let me tell you, I don’t know. Some people are saying it was. _Many_ people. But let’s just say, if the aliens _are_ coming? They’re gonna find out real fast that we don’t mess around. Not with me in charge.

So let’s fix this. Let’s be _smart_. Let’s be _tough_. And let’s make sure Eros never happens again.

And by the way, folks, if you see any blue glowy people floating around? _Run._ It’s bad. Very bad. Okay?

Thank you, everybody. You’re _amazing_ people. Love you all. God bless."
