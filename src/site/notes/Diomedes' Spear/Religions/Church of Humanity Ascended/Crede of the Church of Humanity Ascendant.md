## English
In voice, in mind, in flesh,  
I affirm the path of ascension.  
No gods hold my fate—only my choices.  
I seek to grow, and help others rise.  
I cherish reason, question habit,  
and build where others break.  
The body is a tool; the mind, a forge.  
I will leave each place better than I found it.  
I will shape myself with purpose.  
I will not wait for miracles—  
I will become one.

## Belter Lang
