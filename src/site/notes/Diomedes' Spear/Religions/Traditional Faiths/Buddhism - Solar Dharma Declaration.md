### Preface
With reverence for all sentient beings, we, the representatives of the Three Vehicles—the Theravāda, the Mahāyāna, and the Vajrayāna—offer this declaration to the peoples of Earth, Mars, the Belt, and the far reaches of the solar system.

Six months have passed since the suffering of Eros—a suffering vast, wordless, and without consolation in ordinary things. The minds of many have been cast into fear, grief, and confusion. It is in such times that the Dharma must shine most clearly.

We offer not answers, but right view, right action, and right remembrance.

### I. The Eros Catastrophe Is a Manifestation of Duhkha (Suffering)
The tragedy of Eros reveals the deepest truth of Samsāra: all life conditioned by greed, hatred, and delusion is bound to suffering.

The beings who perished on Eros were victims of karmic consequences not of their own making—but of a system driven by avidyā (ignorance) and tṛṣṇā (craving for power). Those who twisted science for domination have caused great harm and accrued unwholesome karma.

Let us not turn this truth into despair. Let it instead call us back to the Eightfold Path, and to deep reflection on the causes of harm.

### II. On the Treatment of the Dead
Even in death, consciousness leaves an imprint. To die in terror and confusion can bind the mindstream in suffering.

We call on all Buddhist communities in the system to:

Hold collective recitations of the Heart Sūtra and the Bardo Thödol for those who perished in the confusion of Eros.
- Build Kṣitigarbha Shrines on space stations and colonies to honor the dead and guide wandering spirits.
- Declare the Eros Memorial Day on the full moon of the sixth lunar month each year as a day of silence, chanting, and service.

### III. The Protomolecule and the Unknowable
The protomolecule—alien in origin and frightening in its capacity—is neither holy nor unholy. It is phenomenon, conditioned, impermanent, and empty of self. As such, it must be approached not with attachment or fear, but with mindfulness, wisdom, and compassion.

To manipulate such a force with unexamined intention is to invite new forms of suffering. The path of awakening is not in mastering alien power, but in mastering our own minds.

Let scientists and leaders reflect on their motivations and be guided by karuṇā (compassion) and upāya (skillful means).

### IV. Bodhisattva Vow in the Belt
The outer planets and the Belt contain great suffering and loneliness. Many live without access to spiritual guidance, community, or stability. This is an opportunity for those who walk the Bodhisattva path.

We call on monastics, lay practitioners, and teachers to:
- Establish Floating Dharma Centers on trade routes and stations.
- Offer teachings, meditation spaces, and mental health support without regard for wealth, nation, or gravity.
- Embody metta (loving-kindness), even in silence, even when rejected.

As Kannon (Avalokiteśvara) hears the cries of the world, so too must we turn toward those cries—not away.

### V. Let This Be a Turning
The catastrophe of Eros is not the end. It is a turning. We encourage all beings to:

Cultivate non-harming in speech, thought, and action.
- Reflect on the interconnectedness of all life.
- Practice daily meditation, even briefly, to calm the mind and re-center compassion.

If we respond to this moment with clarity and commitment, we may plant the seeds of awakening even in the vacuum between stars.

May all beings be free from suffering.  
May all beings be at peace.  
May this dark turning become a door to light.
