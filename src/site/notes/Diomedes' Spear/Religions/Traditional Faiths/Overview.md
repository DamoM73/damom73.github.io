## Traditions Endure  
Despite humanity reeling from the Eros catastrophe and the terrifying implications of the protomolecule, long-standing religious traditions remain active. On Earth, Mars, and throughout the Belt, faith continues to offer meaning in uncertain times. Religious services, rites, and rituals proceed much as they always have, offering comfort in the face of existential dread.
    
## Spiritual Interpretations of the Eros Event  
The unnatural events surrounding Eros—its infection by the protomolecule, its seemingly intelligent trajectory, and its final crash into Venus—have deeply shaken many. Traditional religious leaders offer differing responses:
- Some frame Eros as divine punishment or warning, urging spiritual reflection or repentance.
- Others reinterpret it through prophecy, comparing the protomolecule to angelic or demonic forces, depending on the faith tradition.
- A minority view it as a test of faith or an opportunity for spiritual growth amid cosmic upheaval.
        
## Faith and the Belt  
In the Belt, where hardship and abandonment are constants, religious institutions often act as community anchors. Belter churches and temples provide medical aid, shelter, and moral leadership, especially where corporations and inner-system powers neglect humanitarian needs.
   
## Political and Ethical Advocacy  
Religious voices, especially on Earth, advocate for humane treatment of Belters, fair distribution of resources, and peaceful resolution of mounting interplanetary tensions. Some figures speak out against the weaponization of the protomolecule, viewing it as sacrilege against creation.
    
## Mormons and the Nauvoo  
The Mormon faith continues its ambitious project: the LDSS Nauvoo, a generational ship intended to find and settle a new Earth-like world. The Eros Incident derails this mission—both literally and spiritually. The commandeering of the Nauvoo by Fred Johnson and the OPA sparks religious and political fallout, with Mormon leaders publicly decrying the act while quietly attempting to recover their lost investment.
    
## Resurgence of Religious Interest  
In the face of existential threats, religious interest sees a modest resurgence, particularly among those with no institutional affiliation. People search for meaning in the wake of Eros, turning to faith, prophecy, and ancient teachings to understand their place in a universe now known to be inhabited—at least historically—by alien forces.
    
## Divides and New Movements  
Though major religions remain largely unchanged, fractures and sects begin to appear, especially among those claiming new revelations in light of the protomolecule. These proto-cults don’t yet hold major sway, but their presence foreshadows the fringe faiths and esoteric movements that will arise after the Ring appears.
