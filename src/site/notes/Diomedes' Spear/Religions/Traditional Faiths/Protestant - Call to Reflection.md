## A Solar Call to Reflection and Witness  
*Issued by the United Council of Protestant Churches (UCPC)*  
*Regarding the Eros Tragedy and the Church’s Role in an Age of Uncertainty*  
*Date: August 5, 2352*  
*Location: Geneva Synod Hall, Earth*

> “God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore we will not fear, though the Earth gives way.”  
> — Psalm 46:1–2a (ESV)

To all congregations in Earth orbit, on Mars, throughout the Belt, and in the deep black, grace and peace to you in the name of Jesus Christ our risen Lord.

Six months have passed since the horror at Eros. In that time, humanity has looked into the void—and found it looking back. The loss of life, the unanswered questions, and the implications of a power beyond human origin have shaken the foundations of civilization and tested the soul of the Church.

Yet we proclaim with confidence: God is not silent. And the Church is not absent.

### I. A Tragedy Born of Human Sin

Let us be clear. Eros was not a divine punishment nor a sign of end-times prophecy. It was a man-made catastrophe, rooted in sin—greed, pride, and the reckless pursuit of dominion. The use of a foreign agent—what many call the protomolecule—for purposes of control and power is a betrayal of humanity’s God-given stewardship.

We must repent of the systems—economic, scientific, and political—that allow such hubris to flourish unchecked.

### II. Bearing Witness to the Lost

Tens of thousands died on Eros. Most will never be named, their bodies scattered, their deaths concealed behind secrecy. But in Christ, no one dies forgotten.

We call upon all Protestant churches to dedicate the first Sunday of September each year as Eros Memorial Sunday. Let every congregation remember the dead with prayer, silence, and the lighting of candles. Let us say their names when they are known, and honor their humanity when they are not.

### III. The Mission of the Church in This Moment

This is not the time for retreat. The Church must step boldly into the breach.
- On Ceres, on Ganymede, and on orbital platforms above Mars, our pastors and chaplains must be visible, available, and accountable.
- Humanitarian relief must be coupled with spiritual care.
- We encourage the planting of new congregations in underserved Belter communities, with support from Earth-based fellowships.

We remind our missionaries and ministers that our calling is not to control narratives, but to embody Christ’s love—especially where injustice thrives and hope runs thin.

### IV. Concerning the Protomolecule
The Church affirms that creation is God's alone, and while scientific exploration is part of humanity’s God-given vocation, any attempt to harness unknown life for power or profit without moral discernment is sin.

We urge research bodies, governments, and corporate actors to:
- Commit to transparency in studying the protomolecule.
- Submit such studies to civilian oversight and independent ethical review.
- Refrain from weaponizing or exploiting unknown biology until its nature is understood and its use justified under moral law.

The Church will not offer blind condemnation, nor will it offer blind blessing.

### V. A Word of Hope in a Shaken Time
The Eros incident has instilled fear in many. Some whisper that we are on the brink of apocalypse. Others have begun to worship the unknown. Both responses arise from despair.

Let the Church respond instead with hope.

God is not threatened by alien biology. Our hope is not in what we understand, but in whom we trust. And we trust a God who raised Jesus from the dead, and who is not diminished by mystery.

Let this decree be distributed to all Protestant councils and mission fellowships across the system. Let it be preached in pulpits, discussed in Bible studies, and prayed over in homes.

The time is urgent, but the Gospel endures.  
We go forward in faith—not because we understand everything, but because we are held by the One who does.

In Christ's service,
