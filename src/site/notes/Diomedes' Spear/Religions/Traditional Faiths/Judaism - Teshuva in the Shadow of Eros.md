### Introduction

To the House of Israel in all its stations—on Earth and Moon, on Mars and in the Belt, and to all who dwell in the covenant of ethical monotheism—

Six months ago, Eros Station—populated by thousands of human souls created b’tzelem Elokim (in the image of God)—became a site of slaughter. This was not a natural disaster, nor an accident. It was engineered devastation, the result of arrogance and disregard for human life.

As Torah-observant communities navigating a new age of stars and systems, we affirm that our obligations remain unchanged: to uphold justice, to guard life, and to bear witness.

### I. The Sanctity of Life and the Crime of Eros

The Torah demands that human life be treated as sacred above all. The deliberate testing and deployment of the so-called "protomolecule" on a civilian population constitutes a chillul Hashem—a desecration of God's name—and a crime that cries out like the blood of Hevel (Abel) from the ground.

The perpetrators are morally and legally culpable under both human and divine law. Those who knew and remained silent bear guilt as well.

As it is written:  
> “Your hands are full of blood… Learn to do good, seek justice, rebuke the oppressor.”  
> — Yeshayahu / Isaiah 1:15-17

### II. Ritual and Liturgical Response

We institute the following communal observances across Jewish communities of the Solar System:
- Yom Zikaron Eros (Eros Memorial Day) shall be observed annually on the 10th of Nisan with the recitation of El Malei Rachamim for the unidentified dead and Kaddish Yatom by all able to do so.
- Where possible, synagogues are encouraged to light 12,000 nerot (memorial candles) representing the minimum estimated dead, in partnership with interfaith communities.
- A chapter of Tehillim (Psalms)—especially chapters 90, 94, and 130—should be added to morning and evening prayers for thirty days following the date of remembrance.

### III. Halachic Considerations on the Protomolecule
Though its nature remains uncertain, the protomolecule is not to be treated as metaphysical or divine. It has no ruach (spirit), and no halachic autonomy.

However, its use raises the gravest ethical concerns under halacha:
- It is forbidden (assur) to participate in research or commerce involving the protomolecule without strict safeguards for human dignity and life.
- Scientists and companies complicit in its weaponization should be subject to public condemnation (herem tziburi), unless they demonstrate sincere teshuvah and accountability.
- Use of the protomolecule for medical purposes remains a matter for further inquiry, requiring supervision by halachic authorities and ethics boards.

### IV. Jewish Presence in the Belt and Beyond
We recognize the suffering and marginalization of Belter communities. Jewish values compel us to act:
- We encourage the creation of Tzedek outposts—mobile humanitarian synagogues offering aid and spiritual support, especially in underserved settlements.
- Jewish medics, scientists, and professionals are halachically encouraged (mitzvah chiyuvit) to volunteer for aid missions in the outer planets.
- Torah study in these areas is to be considered of elevated merit, equivalent to rebuilding a fallen community.

### V. A Call to Teshuvah and Tikun
The catastrophe of Eros is a wound in the fabric of humanity. But in our tradition, no wound is beyond repair. Let this tragedy become a call to:
- Teshuvah (return) — for those who profited from silence.
- Tefillah (prayer) — for the souls of the dead and the healing of the living.
- Tikun (repair) — through action, justice, and righteous innovation.
    

As it is written:  
> “It is not in the heavens… but very near to you, in your mouth and your heart, to do it.”  
> — Devarim / Deuteronomy 30:12-14

### Conclusion
We affirm: the Eros dead will not be forgotten.  
We affirm: our moral voice will not be silenced.  
We affirm: life, and the image of God within it, must remain sacred—even beyond the orbit of Earth.

Zichronam livracha. May their memory be a blessing.
