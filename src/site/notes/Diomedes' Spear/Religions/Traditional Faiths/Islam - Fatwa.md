## Fatwa No. 2352/0815 On the Catastrophe of Eros and the Responsibilities of the Ummah  
*Issued by the Majlis al-Shura al-Islami lil-Nizam al-Shamsi*  
*(Council of Islamic Jurists for the Solar System)*  
*Date: 15 Muharram 1776 A.H. | August 10, 2352 C.E.*  
*Location: Dar al-Ijtihad, Al-Quds Orbit, Earth*

بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ  
In the Name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful

> “And do not go about the earth spreading corruption.”  
> — Surah Al-Baqarah (2:60)

### Preamble
In the wake of the destruction and desecration visited upon Eros Station by agents employing the substance known as the "protomolecule," and in light of the loss of tens of thousands of innocent lives, the Majlis al-Shura al-Islami lil-Nizam al-Shamsi, comprising scholars and jurists from Earth, Mars, Luna, and the Belt, convened to reflect upon the religious and ethical dimensions of this event, and to issue guidance to the Ummah across the system.

### I. The Nature of the Eros Incident
The Eros catastrophe is not a divine punishment, nor is it to be interpreted as a sign of the Final Hour. Rather, it is the result of zulm (oppression), kibr (arrogance), and istighlal (exploitation)—sins committed by those who sought to manipulate what Allah has created without knowledge, mercy, or accountability.

The taking of innocent life on Eros constitutes mass murder, and those responsible—whether individuals, corporations, or state actors—are answerable before Allah. The Qur'an states:

> “Whoever kills a soul… it is as if he had slain all mankind.”  
> — Surah Al-Ma’idah (5:32)

### II. On the Moral Boundaries of Scientific Inquiry
Islam does not oppose science. It commands us to seek knowledge. But knowledge without conscience, power without wisdom, leads only to fitna (corruption).

The protomolecule is not inherently haram (forbidden), but its use as a weapon, and its deployment upon civilians, is munkar (an evil action). It is wajib (obligatory) for Muslim scientists, engineers, and decision-makers to uphold moral boundaries and refuse to partake in or enable such misuse.

We call for the creation of an Independent Solar Tribunal of Ethics, inclusive of scholars from all faiths and traditions, to oversee the handling of this and future extra-terrestrial phenomena.

### III. On the Duty to Remember and Mourn
The victims of Eros must not be forgotten. We call upon the Ummah to:
- Recite Janazah Gha’ib (funeral prayers in absentia) on the 20th of Safar each year, corresponding to the anniversary of the Eros tragedy.
- Establish permanent memorial khutbahs (sermons) in masajid (mosques) across the system reminding believers of the value of every human soul.
    
### IV. On the Role of the Ummah in the Belt and Beyond
It is fard kifayah (a communal obligation) for Muslims to be present where humanity suffers. The Belt, too long neglected by the powers of Earth and Mars, is home to many of our brothers and sisters in faith and in humanity.

We call for:
- The expansion of Islamic relief missions to outer stations, especially Ceres, Ganymede, and Tycho.
- The appointment of Imams and chaplains trained in both Islamic jurisprudence and interplanetary conditions.
- The establishment of Dar al-Amn (Houses of Safety) in every sector where Muslims are present—places of prayer, rest, and refuge for all who seek peace.

### V. On the Question of Alien Origins and Tawhid

The existence of the protomolecule raises deep questions. Yet belief in Tawhid (the Oneness of Allah) remains firm.

The Qur’an tells us:
> “To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and whatever is between them and whatever is beneath the soil.”  
> — Surah Taha (20:6)

Whether the protomolecule is a natural phenomenon or a relic of a lost creation, it is part of Allah’s dominion. It must not be worshipped, feared, or used as justification for abandoning our deen (faith).

### Final Declaration
We urge the Ummah:
- To remain steadfast in prayer, and not fall into despair.
- To seek justice, not revenge.
- To act as a mercy to all creation, as the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was sent.

May Allah grant wisdom to our leaders, sabr (patience) to the afflicted, and guidance to all of humanity as we face these new trials among the stars.

Wa Allahu A'lam (And Allah knows best).
