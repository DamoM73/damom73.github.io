**Kin a’ the Red Horizon,**

We come t’gether t’day not t’ worship no invisible sky spirit, but t’ stand up for what’s real—what’s right here: under our boots, in the breath we draw, and in the grit we carry inside.

Each sol, we roll outta bed under a sky that ain’t ours.  
It’s thin. Cold. Don’t care one lick.  
But every pipe we weld, every meter we dig, every watt we wring out—ain’t just survival. That there’s _devotion_.

**Mars don’t need no prayin’.**  
She’s quiet, but she hears you sweatin’.  
She don’t hand out blessin’s—  
She gives you tests.  
And she’s straighter with you than any old Earth god ever was.

We weren’t kicked outta nowhere.  
We _came_ here.  
And by comin’, we took on somethin’ mighty:  
T’ make this rock a place worth livin’—not just for us, but for whoever comes next.  
T’ sweat without gettin’ patted on the back.  
T’ work without chasin’ glory.  
T’ lay the groundwork and not ask for statues.

Y’all know the Creed:

> _“Ah breathe the air we made.”_

Don’t go forgettin’ how we earned that breath—engineers bustin’ ice veins, cleanin’ crews wrestlin’ sludge lines, little ones learnin’ not t’ run so they don’t wreck their lungs.

**Faith ain’t belief. Faith is _pressure_.**  
It’s knowin’ that even if you slip, someone’ll pick it up.  
That what you did fits into a bigger picture—domes goin’ up, kinfolk growin’ up, red dust turnin’ green.

Some folks back on Earth say it’s sacred.  
Well, bless their hearts—let ‘em keep it.  
We don’t need gold towers or glass cathedrals.  
We got airlocks.  
We got soil tanks.  
We got the patience t’ hold back our comfort so others can breathe easy.

So I ain’t askin’ you t’ kneel.  
Ain’t askin’ you t’ chant.  
I’m askin’ you t’ _choose_.

Tomorrow, you gonna earn your breath?  
You gonna serve the dome or serve yourself?  
You gonna leave Mars a tick better than how you found her?

Then let that dust stick to your boots.  
Let it smudge your sleeves.  
Let it whisper t’ you:  
You _belong_ here.  
And Mars? She don’t forget.

**Walk light. Build deep. Rise honest.**

**Amen—not to heaven, but to habit.**
