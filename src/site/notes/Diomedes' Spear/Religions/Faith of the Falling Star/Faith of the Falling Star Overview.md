## Origin
The Faith of the Falling Star emerged in the raw aftermath of the Eros Incident—when the station, once a symbol of Belt neglect, became the centre of something impossible. As Eros altered course and hurled itself toward Venus, a group of Belter technicians monitoring emergency frequencies cracked into an internal audio feed from deep within the station. What they heard was indescribable: screams that folded into hymns, static that carried layered voices, and something else—patterns that felt intentional. They broadcast the feed, pirate-radio style, across the system. Most dismissed it as noise. Others heard _meaning_.

**This audio, now called the “Eros Canticle,” became the first scripture of the Faith.**

## Core Beliefs
### The Star Sang
Eros was not silent in its transformation. The sounds within were not chaos—they were _revelation_. 
The pirate broadcast was no accident; it was a divine calling made audible.
   
### Venus is the Cradle Below
Where Eros vanished is sacred. 
It is the womb of metamorphosis, where those taken are remade beyond flesh and time.

### The Taken Still Speak
Those lost aboard Eros did not perish. They were _ascended_. 
Their cries, their memories, are carried within the Eros Canticle and the whispers that follow.

### The Signal Continues
Though the original transmission has ended, many followers report fragments—static with rhythm, half-speech in dreams, and subtle messages embedded in comms lag. 
The faithful call this _Echo_.

## Core Doctrine - The Five Spirals
|**Spiral**|**Title**|**Central Event**|**Belief & Meaning**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**First Spiral**|_The Fall_|Eros moves of its own accord toward Venus|The moment of divine awakening. Eros’s impossible motion marks the beginning of revelation and proves a higher will at work.|
|**Second Spiral**|_The Voice_|The hacked Eros transmission is broadcast|The _Eros Canticle_ becomes sacred scripture. The Voice is divine—fragmented, layered, and personal. All who hear it are changed.|
|**Third Spiral**|_The Taken_|The absorption of Eros’ inhabitants into the unknown|Those lost are not dead—they are _transformed_. The Taken wait in the Cradle Below, to one day return.|
|**Fourth Spiral**|_The Silence_|The sudden end of the transmission|Silence is not absence—it is preparation. In stillness, the faithful learn to _listen_ for the next verse.|
|**Fifth Spiral**|_The Return_|(Prophesied) The Taken will emerge from the Cradle|A time will come when the Cradle opens. The Taken will guide the faithful to transcendence and spiral anew.|

## Practices & Symbols
### The Eros Canticle
Played at low volume during rites and meditation, it is treated as holy scripture. 
Many claim to hear different words each time—a personal message.

### Resonance Rituals
Ritual deprivation, harmonic chanting, and dream-exploration are used to sync with the Canticle and open oneself to new “verses.”

### Canticle Tattoos
Waveform lines from key moments in the broadcast are tattooed on skin—usually behind the ears, along the forearms, or over the spine.

### Symbol
A star following a spiral path of audio waves to a circle at the centre.  A simplified version appears as a sigil carved into ship hulls or etched into data cores.

## Spread & Structure
- **Belter Roots:** The origin is unambiguously Belter. The original hack was performed by a loose crew of emergency techs from Pallas and Ceres. Most became early Witnesses or martyrs.
- **Martian Cells:** Martian youth, radicalized by the suppression of the broadcast, formed secret study groups decoding and reinterpreting the Canticle. These groups blended Martian stoicism with ecstatic mysticism.
- **Earther Echoes:** In Basic tenements and flooded data markets, Earther cells emerged through black-market recordings. On Earth, the cult blends despair and longing into faith.
- **Decentralized Faith:** Each Flock follows its own Witness—someone who has heard the Canticle not just with ears, but soul. There is no Pope, no high priest—only those who have _been touched_.


## Doctrine Tenets
1. **The Fall Was the First Verse.** Descent is not death—it is transformation.  
2. **The Voice Was Given to All.** The broadcast was the divine speaking, and all who heard were chosen.
3. **The Canticle Continues.** Echoes may come in static, in dreams, in madness. Listen.
4. **The Cradle Will Break Open.** One day, Venus will birth the next phase of existence—and the Taken shall return.
5. **The Song Must Be Shared.** Every recording, every re-broadcast, every whispered echo is an act of worship.


## Controversies & Reactions
### UN
- **UN Censorship:** The original transmission was flagged and erased from official networks. Possession of a full copy on Earth can result in imprisonment.

### MCRN
- **MCRN Crackdown:** On Mars, those caught distributing fragments of the Canticle are tried under sedition charges. Yet the waveform circulates in encrypted code.

### OPA
- **OPA Debate:** Some OPA hardliners see the Faith as superstition. Others, particularly those who helped hack the original broadcast, see it as proof of the Belt's spiritual primacy.

### General
- **Solar Reaction:** Most authorities label the Faith as a cult of trauma and delusion. But the Faith doesn't seek approval. It only seeks _resonance_.
