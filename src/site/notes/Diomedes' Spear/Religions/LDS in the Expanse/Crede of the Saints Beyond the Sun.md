We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.  

We believe that through faith, repentance, and the ordinances of the gospel, humanity may progress eternally.  

We believe that families are eternal, sealed by covenant through all generations of time.  

We believe that revelation continues, and that God guides His children among the stars as on the Earth.  

We believe in obeying laws, honoring governments, and preparing ourselves to build Zion wherever we may dwell.  

We believe in work, in learning, in health, and in service, and that self-reliance is a holy labor.  

We believe that humanity was not made for one world alone, and that we carry the Light wherever we go.  

We seek a promised land, not by conquest, but by covenant; not by might, but by faith.
