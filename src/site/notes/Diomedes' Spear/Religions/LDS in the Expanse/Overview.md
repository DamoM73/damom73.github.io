## Origins

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often called the Mormons, traces its origins to early 19th-century America, where it emerged as a restorationist movement under Joseph Smith. By the 24th century, the Church remains one of Earth's most enduring religious institutions. It maintains cultural cohesion through its deeply rooted values of community, mission, and self-reliance. In The Expanse, the LDS Church remains headquartered on Earth but has extended its presence into the system, most notably through its construction of the generation ship LDSS Nauvoo, designed to carry colonists to Tau Ceti in search of a new promised land.

## Core Beliefs
- **Eternal Progression**: Human beings are divine in origin and capable of eternal growth and exaltation.
- **The Plan of Salvation**: Life is part of a divine plan involving pre-mortal existence, mortal testing, and post-mortal ascension.
- **Family as Eternal Unit**: Families can be sealed together eternally; procreation and family life are sacred duties.
- **Divine Mission**: Members are called to serve and spread the gospel, often through personal discipline and missionary outreach.
- **Preparedness and Stewardship**: Physical health, education, and emergency preparation are spiritual responsibilities.

## Core Doctrines
- **Restorationism**: Belief that the original church founded by Jesus was restored by Joseph Smith through divine revelation.
- **Scripture**: Canon includes the Bible and the Book of Mormon, as well as modern prophetic revelations.
- **Authority**: Divine priesthood authority is essential for performing sacred ordinances and guiding the Church.
- **Revelation**: God continues to reveal truth through modern prophets and personal inspiration.
- **Self-Governance**: Emphasis on community governance through lay leadership and local councils.

## Practices and Symbols
- **Temple Ordinances**: Sacred rituals performed in temples symbolize eternal covenants and spiritual progression.
- **Missionary Work**: Members often serve missions throughout the solar system, seeking converts or aiding communities.
- **Health Codes**: The Word of Wisdom proscribes alcohol, tobacco, and drugs, encouraging a clean, healthy lifestyle.
- **Sabbath Observance**: Weekly worship and family focus on the Sabbath remain central, even aboard ships.
- **Symbolism**: The LDSS Nauvoo itself was a symbolic temple-ship, its name and structure referencing historical Nauvoo and the temples of Earth.

## Spread and Structure
- **Earth-Based**: The main body of the Church remains Earth-bound, with major centres in North America and the Pacific.
- **Interplanetary Presence**: LDS colonies and missions exist on Luna, Mars, and some Belt stations, though often as small enclaves.
- **Central Leadership**: A First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles direct global Church operations, including space ventures.
- **Local Governance**: Units called stakes, wards, and branches provide spiritual and logistical support to members throughout the system.

## Doctrine Tenets

## Controversies and Reactions
- **Nauvoo Incident**: The commandeering of the LDSS Nauvoo by the OPA during the Eros crisis remains the Church’s most public trauma. Though done in a time of planetary emergency, it was seen by many Mormons as a violation of sacred purpose and property. Courts refused to hear their case due to political complexity, compounding the injury.
- **Perceived Isolationism**: The Church’s self-contained communities and cultural preservation sometimes create friction with the pluralistic and secular cultures of the Belt and Mars.
- **Limited Visibility**: Despite their massive investment in space infrastructure, the LDS Church has no major political role in system-wide governance and few public figures in Belt or Martian politics.
- **Stereotyping**: Some non-members view the Church’s commitment to missionary work and family planning as outdated or controlling, though most LDS adherents in The Expanse are viewed as educated, resourceful, and peaceable.
