## General

| Name         | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Blinded      | A blinded character cannot see and automatically fails ability tests reliant on sight, such as Perception (Seeing).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Deafened     | The character cannot hear and automatically fails ability tests reliant on hearing, such as Perception (Hearing).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Free Falling | The character is effectively weightless in a microgravity or free-fall environment. The character can only move with access to hand-holds, a surface to push off from, or some type of thrust (like from a thruster pack) and, once moving, continues to move with the same speed and trajectory unless acted upon to stop or change their movement. |
| Hindered     | The character’s Speed is halved (round down) and they cannot take the Charge or Run actions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Prone        | The character is lying on the ground. The character cannot take the Charge or Run actions, as they can only move by crawling, and standing up from prone requires a Move action using half the character’s Speed. Melee attacks have a +1 bonus against prone characters, while ranged attacks have a –1 penalty.                                    |
| Restrained   | The character’s Speed becomes 0 and they effectively cannot move. A restrained condition may prevent a character from taking certain other actions as well, defined by the nature of the restraint.                                                                                                                                                  |

| Name        | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Injured     | The character is hurt. The character has a –1 penalty to all tests and is fatigued, unable to take the Charge or Run actions. An injured character who receives an additional injured condition becomes wounded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Wounded     | The character is severely injured. The character has a –2 penalty to all tests and is exhausted, their Speed halved and unable to take the Charge or Run actions. A wounded character who receives an additional injured or wounded condition becomes dying.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Dying       | The character is in danger of perishing. A dying character loses 1 point of Constitution score each round on the start of the character’s turn. When the character’s Constitution score reaches –3, the character dies. Successful first aid applied to a dying character stabilizes their condition, making them helpless, unconscious, and wounded instead. They must recover from these conditions normally (see Interludes in Chapter 5). |
| Helpless    | The character is incapable of doing anything. The character cannot take any actions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Unconscious | The character is unaware of their surroundings or the passage of time. The character falls prone and is helpless, unable to take any actions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
