| Novice       | Every move you make is part of one fluid motion. Using the Move action to stand up, climb, dismount, etc. does not reduce your Speed.                                                                                                           | move does not reduce speed                                             |
| Expert       | When you move, terrain-based hazards do not reduce your Speed.

| Novice       | You can use the Dexterity (Crafting) or Communication (Expression) focuses to create works of art. Choose a field of visual (painting, sculpture, illustration, animation, photography, etc.) or literary (poetry, fiction, scriptwriting, journalism, etc.) arts. The GM determines the time and TN of the test, depending on your intentions, and the Drama Die determines your work’s quality if you succeed. You can sell your work if you know a buyer, giving you a temporary bonus to Income tests equal to half the result of the Drama Die (minimum 1); this bonus disappears upon your first successful Income test to purchase something, or at the end of the current story if you have not used it. As an option you can waive the bonus to Income and gain a temporary reputation instead. This reputation fades over time if you don’t produce other works of similar quality. Any reputation derived from your art disappears after a number of months equal to the result of the Drama Die. | create works of art with crafting or expression [[Diomedes' Spear/Rules/Focuses\|Focuses]] |
| Expert       | You grow as an artist, deepening your mastery of your craft or diversifying your talents. You learn the tools and tricks of a new artistic field or gain a +1 bonus to ability tests to create works of art in a field you are trained in.

| Novice       | You can attempt to make a contact out of an NPC with a Neutral or better attitude toward you with a successful Communication (Persuasion) test. The GM sets the target number based on the likelihood of you knowing the character or having mutual friends. The more distant the character’s origin or social class from yours, the more difficult the test. If you succeed, the new contact’s attitude shifts one step in your favour and they readily provide information without a test, as long as it wouldn’t harm them. They will not perform other favours without further persuasion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | make contact out of NPC                    |
| Expert       | Once you’ve established a contact, you can try to get a favour from them with a single successful Communication (Persuasion) test, regardless of their attitude toward you and without engaging in a complex social interaction. The target number is based on the nature of the favour and whether it puts the contact in any danger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | contact favour out of **persuasion** test  |
| Master       | Your social skills can turn a contact into an trusted ally. If you do a significant favour for an established contact, they become Very Friendly towards you, and any potential risk in the favours you ask of them does not affect the target number of the Communication (Persuasion) test from the Expert degree. If they’re already Very Friendly, they become zealously loyal; you do not need to make an ability test to ask favours of them, regardless of the danger involved, and the GM can use your ally to provide prompts if you become stuck in the course of a story in the form of unsolicited advice or favours. Allies’ attitudes can degrade if they’re not treated well, but do not do so simply with the passage of time. You can drift apart for a decade and they’ll still be as loyal as when you last met. | significant favour turns contact into ally |

| Expert       | With access to medical supplies and tools, you can treat some conditions. With an hour and a basic TN 11 Intelligence (Medicine) test you can remove a wounded condition, leaving the patient only injured (see Conditions in Chapter 1). You can also remove other medical-related conditions with proper time and treatment, at the GM’s discretion, using the Interlude guide lines in Chapter 5. | remove condition with TN11 **medicine** test |
| Master       | You can perform complex medical procedures to restore a patient to a normal, healthy condition, and you can re-roll any failed Intelligence (Medicine) test, but must keep the result of the second roll. When using Intelligence (Medicine) as a primary investigation focus, you generate +1 SP on any roll that generates stunt points.                                                           | re-roll failed **medicine** test             |

When you perform the Whatever’s Handy combat stunt, the penalty of your makeshift weapon is reduced by 1 and it lasts 2d6 rounds before breaking. If improvising a tool instead of a weapon, you can perform tests that require the tool, but you don’t generate SP while doing so.                                                                                      | **Whatever’s Handy** [[Diomedes' Spear/Rules/Stunts#Combat Stunts\|Stunts#Combat Stunts]] -1 to penalty & last 2d6 rounds |
| Master       | You can turn failure into some measure of success. If you roll doubles on a failed test, you generate SP equal to the result of the Drama Die –2 (minimum 1). The test still fails, but you can try to salvage the situation with a stunt you perform with the SP you gain. Unfortunately, your stunt cannot achieve your original intended action. The GM determines if the desired stunt is permitted, based on the situation. | Generate SP on failed tests                                                   |

| Novice       | Your treatment allows a patient to add your Intelligence (and Medicine focus, if any) to a test to avoid or overcome a medical hazard, or grants the patient a new test to overcome that hazard, if there is one. This includes saving a patient from dying and reviving an unconscious character.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Expert       | If you treat a patient, you can alleviate the effects of the exhausted, fatigued, injured, or wounded conditions. This takes an advanced TN 11 Intelligence (Medicine) test (threshold 5) with each roll taking one minute. If you succeed, the patient ignores the effects of those conditions for 1d6 hours. The conditions are still present, however, and the effects return when the duration ends or if any of the conditions worsen, such as an injured character becoming wounded, for example. |
| Master       | You can quickly treat wounds to prevent them from becoming serious. If you treat a wounded condition within an hour of it occurring, you can make a basic TN 13 Intelligence (Medicine) test. Success down grades the wounded condition to injured.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Expert       | Your targets become too focused on you to do anything else. When you use the Over Here! exploration stunt, the bonus your allies gain is +2 instead of +1, and you gain a +1 bonus yourself.                 |
| Master       | When you use a Communication focus in combat and roll doubles, you gain +1 SP.                                                                                                                               |

| Expert       | Analysis of your observation often leads to insight. On a successful Perception test, you can spend 2 SP to make a second, immediate Perception test with the same TN but with a different focus than the first, and gain additional information (if any) from a successful test with the second focus. This includes additional information when you uncover the clue within a lead. |
| Master       | Nothing escapes your scrutiny. On a successful Perception test, you can spend 2 SP and gain a +2 bonus to all Perception tests involving the same object or subject as the first test for the duration of the encounter.                                                                                                                                                              |

| Master       | You can agitate a crowd. If you make a successful Communication (Persuasion) test when addressing a group and the result of your Drama Die is 5 or 6, you rouse them to immediate action. You can’t necessarily control what they do, though you can try to do so with Communication (Leadership) tests, but they take your words to heart and act on them regardless. |

If you have at least 15 minutes to observe a crowd before performing or speaking in front of them, you gain a +1 bonus to any Communication-based tests to persuade or entertain them. You can also choose a number of individuals in the crowd equal to your Perception (minimum 1); at the end of the 15 minutes of observation you know their initial attitudes toward you, and you know if they changed by the end of your performance and, if so, by how much. |
| Master       | You can add an additional form of perfor mance to your repertoire. When performing, you exude confidence and style. You may perform the With a Flourish stunt while performing in front of an audience for 3 SP, and its effects last until the end of the day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

If you are standing next to an oppo nent and that opponent moves within 2 meters of one of your allies, you can move adjacent to the opponent before they finish their turn, even if it would surpass your Speed. Your Speed is 0 on your next turn. |

| Novice       | If you fail a Dexterity (Stealth) test, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll.                             |
| Expert       | You know how to get the drop on opponents. You can perform the Seize the Initiative stunt for 2 SP.                                   |
| Master       | You are a skilled observer. If you fail a Perception (Seeing) test, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll. |
## Tactical Awareness
You move calmly and expertly while in combat.

| Novice       | You can take the Melee Attack or Ranged Attack action at any point during your movement. Normally you have to finish your movement before attacking.                                                                                    |
| Expert       | You seem to have eyes in the back of your head. When you perform the Take One for the Team exploration stunt, you only take half the damage from a trap or hazard and your ally remains unscathed.                                      |
| Master       | You are hard to pin down in combat. Opponents do not gain an attack bonus for outnumbering you in melee. If you also have the Expert degree in the Single Weapon Style, your Defence bonus increases to +3 when fighting in that style. |

## Fighting Styles
### Dual Weapon Style
You can fight in hand-to-hand combat with a weapon in your primary hand and another in your off-hand (a secondary weapon). Unless otherwise stated, attacks come from the primary weapon.

| Category     | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Requirements | Dexterity 2 or higher                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Novice       | While wielding two close combat weapons, if you take the Activate action, you gain either a +1 bonus on your melee attack rolls or a +1 Defence bonus vs. melee attacks until the end of the encounter. You can switch the bonus with another Activate action.                                                                       |
| Expert       | You can perform the Lightning Attack stunt for 2 SP instead of the usual 3, but the extra attack must come from your secondary weapon.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Master       | You can overwhelm opponents with attacks from both weapons. If you make a Melee Attack with your primary weapon and you are not charging, you can make another attack with your secondary weapon as a minor action. The second attack cannot generate stunt points, and you only add half of your Strength (rounded down) to damage. |
### Grappling Style
You’re skilled in restraining and subduing opponents in unarmed combat.

| Category     | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Requirements | Fighting (Grappling) focus                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Novice       | If you fail an opposed Fighting (Grappling) test to avoid being grappled, as per the Grapple stunt’s description in Chapter 5, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll. |
| Expert       | If you successfully hit an opponent with an unarmed attack and choose a stunt from the Grappling category, you gain 1 additional SP to apply.                                                    |
| Master       | You can perform the Pin stunt for 3 SP instead of the usual 4. In addition, your penalty to Defence when using the Grapple and Pin stunts is halved.                                             |
### Overwhelm Style
In hand-to-hand combat, you are relentless and over whelming.

| Category     | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Requirements | Fighting 2 or higher                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Novice       | When you make a close combat attack, you can take up to a –3 penalty on your attack roll to receive a corresponding bonus to your damage roll.                                                                                                                                    |
| Expert       | Your expertise makes you dangerous. When you succeed with a close combat attack, you can add your focus bonus for that attack to your damage total.                                                                                                                               |
| Master       | You break opponent’s defences with brutal or relentless attacks. If you spend 3 SP after a successful attack, your target must make an opposed Strength (Might) test against your attack roll; if they fail, they suffer a –2 penalty to Defence until the end of your next turn. |
### Pistol Style
Between the quick and the dead, you prefer the former.

| Category     | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Requirements | Accuracy (Pistols) focus                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Novice       | You are deadlier close-up. You gain a +1 bonus to damage with pistols against targets within 6 meters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Expert       | If you have a pistol in your hand, or draw or grab one as your first available action, you can roll initiative with an Accuracy (Pistols) test instead of a Dexterity (Initiative) test. You can also generate stunt points with this test, unlike a normal initiative roll, and spend them on general combat or gun stunts. |
| Master       | When hitting a target with a shot from a pistol, you can add your Dexterity to the damage total.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
### Rifle Style
A rifle is far more dangerous in your hands.

| Category     | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Novice       | You can assume a highly ready stance; as long as you are not moving more than half your normal speed, you can make an attack with a loaded rifle you are holding as a reaction before rolling initiative, even if surprised. This attack uses up your major action for the round, which means that you only have a minor action available during your next turn. |
| Expert       | You ignore 2 points of any armour bonus provided by cover when using a longarm or assault rifle. When using those weapons, you also ignore the attack roll penalty imposed by the Human Shield action stunt.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Master       | Penalties to the attack roll due to range do not apply to your attacks with a rifle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
### Self-defence Style
You are trained in martial arts focused on defence and deflection.

| Novice       | You use your opponent’s momentum against them. When a melee attack misses you, you can use the Grapple action stunt as a reaction without spending any SP. In addition, you can perform the Knock Prone action stunt for 1 SP instead of the usual 2 against an opponent you have grappled.                                                                                                |
| Expert       | Your grip is difficult to break. If you fail a Fighting (Grappling) test, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Master       | You counter an opponent with grace and skill. When you perform the Disarm stunt, you can retain hold of the weapon. In addition, when you spend SP on Knock Prone after making a Fighting (Grappling) attack, you may automatically move your opponent 2 yards for no additional SP cost. You may increase this distance with the Skirmish stunt. The enemy falls prone after being moved. |
