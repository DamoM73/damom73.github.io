| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| All-out Attack | You attack one adjacent enemy in close combat, throwing the full force of your Strength behind the attack at the cost of your ability to defend yourself. If your attack hits, you do +1 damage, but whether or not the attack hits, you have a –1 to your Defence until the start of your next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Charge         | You move up to half your Speed (rounded down) in meters and finish with a close combat attack against an adjacent enemy. If you moved at least 4 meters in a straight line before reaching your target, you gain a +1 bonus on your attack roll. You cannot take this action if you are prone (you’d need to use the Move action to stand up first).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Defend         | You focus on defending yourself. Until the start of your next turn, you gain a +2 bonus to your Defence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Melee Attack   | You attack an enemy within 2 meters of you in hand-to-hand combat (see Making Attacks).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Ranged Attack  | You fire or throw a ranged weapon at one visible enemy within range (see Making Attacks).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Run            | You move up to twice your Speed in meters, sacrificing the ability to perform another action so you can move farther. You cannot take this action if you are prone (you’d need to use the Move minor action to stand up first).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Stunt Attack   | Instead of trying to damage an opponent, you focus on performing a specific action stunt, like subduing an enemy with a hold instead of hurting them (a Grapple stunt). Roll an attack test as usual. A successful test awards you 1 SP of a type appropriate for the attack, but the attack itself inflicts no damage. If you roll doubles, you earn additional SP as normal and may choose a stunt that damages your opponent, but there is still no damage from the base attack. You can attempt stunt attacks against objects as well as opponents, though the GM may rule that some stunts do not apply. |

## Minor Actions
| Action           | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Activate         | This action allows you to start using certain abilities or items, such as certain talents or technology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Aim              | You take the measure of your opponent and plan your next strike. If your next action after Aim is a melee or ranged attack, you gain a +1 bonus on your attack roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Guard Up         | You balance action and defense. Add +1 or +2 (your choice) to your Defense until the end of the round. However, the same modifier becomes a penalty to all tests you make, even opposed tests, until the end of the round as well (unlike the Defend action, which lasts until the beginning of your next turn). If you choose this minor action, you must do it before any major action on your turn, and you cannot Defend on the same turn.                                                                                            |
| Move             | You move up to your Speed in meters and can combine this with actions like dropping prone, standing up, or climbing into a vehicle, but each of these types of actions consumes half your Speed (rounded down).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Prepare          | When you take this action, you postpone your major action. You declare one major action and your choice to Prepare it. After you do so, the next person in the initiative order acts, and so on, but at any time until the beginning of your next turn, you can interrupt another character and take your prepared action immediately. If you don’t use the prepared action by your next turn, you lose it.                                                                                                                               |
| Press the Attack | You stand ready to pursue an enemy if they fall back or flee. You can take this action after successfully striking an enemy target with a melee attack (whether you inflict damage or not). After you declare this action, if that foe moves away from you, you may immediately move up to your Speed in meters in direct pursuit at no additional cost in actions. This occurs immediately after your foe’s movement, before they can do anything else.                                                                                  |
| Ready            | You draw a weapon, pull out a device, or otherwise ready a stowed item. As part of this action, you can put away something already in hand. You could holster a pistol and pull out a grenade with the same Ready action, for example.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Stand Firm       | You stand firm and prepare to resist any effort to move you. Until the start of your next turn, any enemy using the Skirmish or Knock Prone stunts to move you or knock you to the ground must succeed in an opposed test of their Strength (Might) against your choice of your own Strength (Might) or Dexterity (Acrobatics). If you win the test, the attempt fails. If the attacker wins, the attempt proceeds normally. The attacker still spends the stunt points, regardless of whether the attempt to move you succeeds or fails. |

## Attack Roll Modifiers

|    0     | Normal circumstances.                                                                                                                                  |

|    +3    | Defender is unaware of the attack.                                                                                                                     |

## Morale Tests
Characters who fail a Willpower (Morale) test attempt to break off from combat or even surrender.

Conditions triggering a morale test:
- When more than half of the side’s combatants are taken out of the fight
- When the side’s leader or champion is taken out of the fight
- When fighting on will clearly mean being trapped or surrounded
- When the other side reveals a serious or over whelming advantage
- When they fail an opposed TN15 Persuasion test.
