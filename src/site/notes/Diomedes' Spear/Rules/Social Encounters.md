## Impressions and Attitudes
First impressions matter. The GM decides how an NPC feels about you based on that character’s motives and emotions.

NPCs will never defy their most deeply held values or sacrifice their personal safety without an exceptional circumstance coming into play.
### Determining Attitude
Roll 3D6 plus following modifiers

| Modifier        | Details                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Communication   | Add the Communication ability score of the character taking the lead in making contact. If a Communication focus would apply to the first impression, add its bonus as well. |
| Reputation      | Add +2 for a Reputation that would impress the NPC. Impose -2 for a Reputation that would offend the NPC.                                                                    |
| Other modifiers | The GM can add other modifiers to the roll based on the NPC’s known feelings and motives.                                                                                    |

| ----- | ------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| < 3   | Very Hostile  | -3       | The very hostile NPC can barely contain their dislike, and is inclined to respond to contact with either violence or by leaving the characters’ presence. They may nurse a grudge and oppose the characters in the future. This is a rare spontaneous impression, and the GM should come up with a specific reason why any first impression would get a Very Hostile response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 4-5   | Hostile       | -2       | The hostile NPC reacts to contact with ire, but might disguise this. They either refuse to provide help, or undermine the characters’ apparent interests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 6-8   | Standoffish   | -1       | The standoffish NPC would prefer that the characters just leave them alone. They either avoid the characters, ignore them, or firmly ask interlopers to go away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 9-11  | Neutral       | +0       | The neutral NPC hasn’t decided things either way about characters making contact, and responds with cool caution, bored disinterest, or polite detachment, depending on their personality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 12-14 | Open          | +1       | The open NPC is curious or inclined to listen to the characters, and reacts appropriately based on their own motives and interests. Things could go either way. A negative variation of Open is Cowed, where the NPC is a bit afraid of what the characters might do if they don’t act receptive. Once the threat appears to be gone, the NPC becomes Standoffish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 15-17 | Friendly      | +2       | The friendly NPC takes a shine to characters making contact and is inclined to help them, but hesitates to provide any assistance that could cause them problems. A negative variation of Friendly is Shaken, where the NPC provides assistance out of fear. Once the threat appears to be gone, the NPC becomes Hostile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 18+   | Very Friendly | +3       | The very friendly NPC is exceptionally welcoming, and provides gestures of respect or hospitality without being prompted. The NPC may provide extraordinary help, though nothing that contradicts their values. This is a rare spontaneous impression, and the GM should come up with a specific reason why any first impression would get a Very Friendly response. A negative variation of Very Friendly is Terrified, where the NPC anxiously does anything possible to avoid a perceived (or very real) threat. Once the threat is gone and the NPC feels safe, their attitude shifts to Very Hostile. |
## Interactions
### Simple Social Interactions
Communication test vs NPC Willpower

### Detailed Social Interactions
Goal is to change an NPC’s attitude to one where they feel inclined to do something in your favour.

#### Social Combat
Determine shifts required:
- Decide NPC’s current attitude, and the attitude required to comply with your wishes.
- Note number of shifts to move along character
- Add 1 shift to focus the NPC’s attention toward doing what you wish
- Can add 1 or 2 shifts to represent the NPC’s greater resistance to your efforts if the desired actions would inconvenience or trouble them in some way

Shifts can be achieved through:
- **Social manoeuvres**:
	- Each shift becomes an action
	- Can be opposed tests or tasks to complete
	- Clear additional shifts first
	- Utterly failing -> *may* set back progress by one or more shifts
- **Grand gesture**:
	- perform a single ambitious gesture intended to influence the NPC in one fell swoop
	- advanced test -> 3-5 x number of shifts
	- achieving threshold -> success, falling short -> nothing
