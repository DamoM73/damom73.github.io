## General Qualities
| Quality        | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Effect                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Durable        | The item is built to last. Under normal conditions, it lasts twice as long and for tests involving damaging it, it has +2 Toughness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | +2 to item toughness     |
| Effective      | The item works better than a regular item of its type, gaining a +1 bonus to one of its abilities. This could be damage, armour bonus, or some other ability used for outcome or effectiveness but not for tests (see Fine, following, for that quality) or a 50% improvement in overall output. A Very Effective item has two qualities and provides a +2 bonus or a 100% improvement. | +1 or +2 to ability      |
| Fast           | The item works fast. It takes half the usual time to use a regular item of its type. For something used during action time, the character gains a +2 bonus to initiative when using the item                                                                                                                                                                                            | +2 initivate             |
| Favoured Stunt | The item is either especially well-suited for performing a particular stunt, granting a –1 SP modifier to its cost, or else the item grants access to a unique stunt the character can perform while wielding or using it. Each favoured stunt is a separate quality and an item can have more than one.                                                                                | -SP to designated stunt  |
| Fine           | The item’s quality is such that the character gains a +1 bonus to tests for using or wielding it. Very Fine items have two qualities and provide a +2 bonus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | +1 or +2 to tests        |
| Impressive     | The item’s quality is clearly apparent, providing a +1 bonus to social and roleplaying tests where such things are noteworthy, such as trying to make a good impression while wearing an Impressive outfit or intimidating someone with an Impressive weapon. Very Impressive items have two qualities and provide a +2 bonus.                                                          | +1 or +2 to social tests |
| Light          | The item is lighter and more compact than normal, reducing any penalty to Dexterity and Speed it normally imposes by 1. Very Light items have two qualities and reduce penalties by 2.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | -1 or -2 to Dex penalty  |

## General Flaws
| Flaw        | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Effect                                   |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Fragile     | The item wasn’t made to take much punishment. A deliberate attempt to break it always succeeds. Further more, when a test to use the item fails and the Drama Die is 3 or less, the item breaks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | breaks on failed test with DD < 4        |
| Heavy       | The item is heavier or bulkier than normal, imposing a –1 penalty to the Dexterity and Speed of a character carrying or wearing it. Very Heavy items have two flaws and impose a –2 penalty to Dexterity and Speed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | +1 or +2 to Dex penalty                  |
| Ineffective | The item can’t inflict damage as easily as a proper weapon, imposing a –1 or –2 penalty to damage rolls, with a minimum damage roll of 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | -1 or -2 to damage                       |
| Poor        | The overall poor quality of the item imposes a –1 penalty to tests using or wielding it. Very Poor items have two flaws and impose a –2 penalty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | -1 or -2 to tests                        |
| Shoddy      | The item’s flaws are glaringly apparent, imposing a –1 penalty to social and roleplaying tests where such things are noteworthy, such as trying to intimidate someone with a Shoddy weapon, or make a good first impression in a Shoddy outfit. The GM may adjust the penalty, depending on the circumstances, but it is always negative.                                                                                                                                                                               | -1 or -2 to social tests                 |
| Slow        | The item works, but not fast. It takes twice as much time to use as a regular item of its type. For something that can be used with a major action during action time, a Slow item requires a Ready action after it is used each time to prepare it to be used again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Requires ready action before use         |
| Unreliable  | The item works...most of the time. When a test involving the item fails and the Drama Die is a 3 or less, the item stops working. If the item does not require a test to use, the GM should roll 3d6 when the item needs to work. On a total roll of 10 or less where the Drama Die is a 3 or less, the item stops working. Getting an Unreliable item working again takes either an interlude to fix it or, during action time, a TN 13 challenge test with a success threshold of 10 and a time increment of 1 round. | stops working on failed test with DD < 4 |

## Ranged Weapon Qualities
| Quality        | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Effect                                        |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Armor Piercing | The weapon’s rounds reduce the Toughness bonus of worn armour by –2 in terms of reducing their damage. Unfortunately, armour-piercing rounds also have the ability to punch through vacuum sealed bulkheads, so a missed attack with one on a spaceship or station near an outside wall may cause a hull breach. Roll 1d6; on a roll of 1 or 2, a breach occurs and the air begins rushing out of the compartment. See the Threats chapter for details on suffocation hazards | -2 to target toughness                        |
| Automatic      | The weapon reloads and fires automatically so long as its trigger is depressed. This makes the weapon capable of performing stunts with the (Automatic) quality on the Gun Stunts table in Chapter 5.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | can take automatic stunts                     |
| High Capacity  | The weapon carries a substantial amount of ammunition. Ignore the first roll indicating the weapon has run out of ammo (see Weapon Capacity, following).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Ignore first reload                           |
| Long Range     | The weapon’s effective ranges are doubled. See Range under Making Attacks in Chapter 5 for details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | effective ranges x 2                          |
| Spreading      | The weapon fires a spreading cone of pellets, shot, or similar small ammunition, like a shotgun. It does one die less damage, but can hit all targets within a roughly 30° cone  in front of the shooter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | -1 damage, hits all targets in 30° cone       |
| Tracer         | The weapon fires rounds that glow, leaving visible trails (tracers) behind. A tracer weapon allows the user to take the Aim action as a free action so long as the weapon was fired on the previous round (see Aim under Minor Actions in Chapter 5).                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | automatic aim action if fired on round before |
| Tranquilizer   | A tranquilizer or tranq weapon fires a hypodermic dart preloaded with a dose of a drug, usually a powerful tranquilizer to knock out its target. The dart won’t penetrate any armour, but if it hits an unarmoured target, the character must make a TN 13 Constitution (Tolerance) test or become unconscious. A successful test means the character is only fatigued.                                                                                                       | target TN13 Tolerance test to remain consious |

## Makeshift Weapon Flaws
| Flaw    | Details                                                                                                                                                         | Effect                            |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Clumsy  | The weapon is awkward to wield, imposing a –1 or –2 penalty to attack tests.                                                                                    | -2 to tests                       |
| Fragile | The weapon wasn’t made to take much punishment. When an attack with it misses and the Drama Die is 3 or less, the object breaks and becomes useless as a weapon | breaks on failed test with DD < 4 |
| Weak    | The object can’t inflict damage as easily as a proper weapon, imposing a –1 or –2 penalty to damage rolls, with a minimum damage roll of 1.                     | -1 or -2 damage                   |
