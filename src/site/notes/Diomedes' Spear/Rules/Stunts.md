| Cost | Stunt                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :--: | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-3  | **Adrenaline Rush**      | Regain Fortune equal to the SP spent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 1-3  | **Momentum**             | Gain +3 to initiative per SP spent, changing your place in the initiative order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 1-3  | **Duck and Weave**       | Gain +1 to Defence per SP spent until the beginning of your next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 1-3  | **Take Cover**           | If there is cover available in your immediate vicinity, gain a cover rating equal to SP spent, up to the maximum rating available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|  1+  | **Guardian Angel**       | Choose an ally within 5 meters of you. If they would take damage before your next turn, 1 damage point per SP spent transfers to you instead as you interpose yourself in front of the attack.                                                                                                                                                                      |
|  1+  | **Skirmish**             | Move yourself or your attack’s target 2 meters in any direction for each 1 SP you spend. If this movement would expose the target to a hazard, such as pushing them off a ledge, roll an opposed test of your attacking ability versus the target’s Strength (Might) or Dexterity (Acrobatics), whichever is higher. If you lose the test, the target doesn’t move. |
|  1   | **Whatever’s Handy**     | Immediately arm yourself with anything in your environment you can reasonably wield as a makeshift weapon (see Makeshift Weapons in this Chapter 5 of The Expanse RPG).                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|  2+  | **Group Tactics**        | Choose one ally to move 2 meters in a direction of their choosing for each 2 SP spent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|  2   | **Double-Team**          | Choose one ally to make an immediate attack on your target, who must be within range and sight of the ally’s attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|  2   | **Injure**               | If your target has lost half or more of their Fortune, your attack imposes an injured condition so long as its damage exceeds the target’s Toughness. This condition does not reduce the attack’s damage.                                                                                                                                                           |
|  2   | **Knock Prone**          | Knock your enemy prone (see Prone under Conditions in Chapter 1 of The Expanse RPG).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|  2   | **Lightning Attack**     | Make a second attack on your turn, either against the same target or a different target.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  2   | **Overcome Toughness**   | Against this attack’s damage, the target’s Toughness is considered to be half its normal value, rounded down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  2   | **Taunt**                | Roll an opposed test of Communication (Deception) vs. Willpower (Self-Discipline) against any target within 10 meters of you; if you win, they must attack or oppose you in some way on their next turn.                                                                                                                                                            |
|  2   | **Vicious Blow**         | Inflict an extra 1d6 damage on this attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|  3   | **Expose**               | Destroy or move any one object in weapon range, such as a door or crate, that could provide cover. This can take out small sections of larger objects like pillars or walls. The GM may rule some objects are too heavy or tough to be removed by this stunt, such as the bulkheads of spaceships and stations.                                                     |
|  3   | **Shock and Awe**        | When you succeed at a non-attack physical feat or take an opponent out, anyone who witnesses it rolls Willpower (Courage) or (Morale) vs. your Strength (Intimidation). If you win, they suffer a −1 to the next opposed roll they make against you, or a −1 to their Defence vs. your next attack against them, whichever comes first.                             |
|  4   | **Knock Out**            | If your target has lost half or more of their Fortune, your attack imposes an unconscious condition so long as its damage exceeds the target’s Toughness.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|  4   | **Seize the Initiative** | Move to the top of the initiative order until someone else seizes the initiative. You may get to take another turn before some others act again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  5   | **Lethal Blow**          | Inflict an extra 2d6 damage on this attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|  5   | **Wound**                | If your target has lost half or more of their Fortune, your attack imposes a wounded condition so long as its damage exceeds the target’s Toughness. This condition does not reduce the attack’s damage.                                                                                                                                                            |

### Gun Stunts
| Cost | Stunt                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :--: | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-3  | **Overwatch**                    | Your opponent suffers −1 to attack rolls per SP spent until the start of your next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 1-4  | **Precision Marksmanship**       | If you make an attack with a firearm that benefits from an Aim bonus before the end of your next turn, increase the aim bonus by +1 per SP spent.                                                                                                                               |
| 1-3  | **Ricochet**                     | Make a trick shot that ignores (SP spent) of the armour rating of a target behind cover.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 1-3  | **Short Burst (Automatic)**      | Ignore one point of your opponent’s Toughness per SP spent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 1-3  | **Strafe (Automatic)**           | Immediately move up to (SP spent) meters in any direction, and apply this attack to anyone within (SP spent) meters of your original target; you can’t selectively exclude anyone in the area. Halve the damage dealt to the additional targets (round up).                     |
| 1-5  | **Suppressive Fire (Automatic)** | At the end of each character’s turn until the start of your next turn (including allies and your current target), make a new attack against that character if they’re within (SP) meters of the spot where your target stands right now.                                        |
|  1   | **Rapid Reload**                 | Next time you miss with a firearm, immediately reload without checking against Capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|  2+  | **Efficient Gunner**             | Next time you miss with a firearm, subtract 1 from the Drama Die’s result for each 2 SP spent, for purposes of checking against Capacity.                                                                                                                                       |
|  2   | **Long Burst (Automatic)**       | Make a second attack against the same target or a different one within 5 meters of the first; take a −2 to this attack roll, but gain a +2 to the damage roll if you hit. Immediately check ammo against Capacity afterward.                                                    |

|  1   | **Good Instincts**         | Make a Perception test using an appropriate focus (GM’s choice) with the same TN as the test you just made to learn the most likely immediate consequence of the action you just performed.                                                                                                                                   |

|  2   | **Over Here!**             | Your flashy action makes you the centre of attention. Each of your allies gains +1 to their next test to hide or pass scrutiny in this encounter, such as Dexterity (Stealth) or Communication (Disguise). Any action an opponent takes until then automatically targets you.                                                 |
|  2   | **Take One for the Team**  | When you successfully avoid damage from hazard but an ally doesn’t, you may take the damage for that ally while they remain unaffected.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  3   | **Cover Your Tracks**      | Whether you’re hacking into a network, evading the cops, or infiltrating a military base, you impose a −2 on all future rolls to follow your trail related to this test.                                                                                                                                                      |
|  3   | **High Tech Hustle**       | With an injection of technobabble or a quick mod to a device, you sidestep one minor complication impeding your current goal, or give yourself the ability to perform one task you otherwise couldn’t in the current situation, at the GM’s discretion.                                                                       |
|  4   | **It Wasn’t Me**           | You leave evidence another character is responsible for the results of your test, such as breaking and entering, cheating at cards, or uploading a computer virus.

This doesn’t dictate anything about their situation, attitude, or identity; these are all up to the GM. |

|  1   | **Flashback**                       | This test reminds you of something important you forgot. The GM reveals the identity or existence of another source of information you didn’t know about (**Simple**); treat one of your tangential focuses as a primary one on the next test you make to unlock a lead related to this test (**Detailed**). |
|  2   | **Intuition**                       | The GM reveals a fact about the object of your test you could not have noticed or deduced simply by interacting with it (**Simple**); when you uncover a clue, you gain two new leads instead of one, making the path branch (**Detailed**).                                                                 |
|  3   | **Lucky Break (Detailed)**          | This test’s result leads fortuitously to putting two and two together later. Treat one irrelevant focus as a tangential one on the next test you make to unlock a lead related to this test.                                                                                                                 |
|  4   | **Down the Rabbit Hole (Detailed)** | If this test led to a reveal, the GM also provides a brand new lead about a new subject that will lead to greater rewards.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| :--: | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1-3  | **Making an Offer** | Your test implies a promise or olive branch, temporarily shifting the target’s Attitude toward you up by one per SP spent (even if this test already shifted it); it shifts back by the same amount as soon as you fail a social test against them. Inapplicable when performing a grand gesture.                                                                                          |
|  1   | **Read the Room**   | The GM reveals the current Attitude, or an intention or mood indicator, for one character present of your choice, in reaction to your test. You can choose this stunt multiple times per roll. Characters with either the Communication (Deception) or Willpower (Self-Discipline) focus may roll vs. your Perception (Empathy) to avoid this.                                             |
|  2   | **On the Fence**    | Choose a character you didn’t target who’s Standoffish, Neutral, or Open toward you. They’re convinced to take your side in the conflict, as long as they don’t already oppose you (**Simple**); shift their Attitude toward you up by one for the rest of the encounter (**Detailed**).                                                                                                   |
|  3   | **Bad Form**        | Immediately regain the SP you spent on this stunt, plus 1 more. Then choose any character present; they now consider you a rival, threat, or enemy, shifting their Attitude to Hostile if it was Standoffish or Neutral, or shifting it to its negative variation if it was more positive. Inapplicable if all NPCs present are already Hostile toward you.                                |
|  3   | **Cast Out**        | Your action shames or embarrasses another character present, imposing a −2 penalty on their next social roll against anyone but you in this encounter (**Simple**) or worsening the Attitude of one other character present toward them by one shift (**Detailed**).                                                                                                                       |
|  4   | **Risky Business**  | Your action reveals a secret or contains a significant lie, shifting your target’s Attitude toward another character in the scene from Neutral or worse to Very Hostile; it also worsens your target’s Attitude toward you by one shift, as they’re inclined to shoot the messenger. If you lied and the target later finds out, their Attitude toward you shifts to Very Hostile as well. |
|  5   | **Meddle**          | Your action brings others together or drives a wedge between them. Choose two other characters present and shift their Attitudes toward each other up or down by one (both in the same direction)                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|  1   | **Cards on the Table**      | If you were completely honest when making this test, your target must be completely honest in the next social test they make against you during this encounter. This doesn’t stop either character from omitting information or offering misleading truths.                                                                                                        |
|  1   | **Making an Entrance**      | If this is your first action of the encounter, gain +1 to your next opposed roll against one character who witnessed it. You can choose this stunt multiple times per roll.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|  2   | **And Another Thing**       | Make a second, related test as part of your action, before anyone else has a chance to respond or make any tests of their own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|  2   | **Hidden Message**          | Your words convey a different message to one person than to everyone else who hears them; the character you choose is the only one who can decipher your true meaning.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|  2   | **Sway the Crowd**          | Your words affect one additional person of your choice. You may choose this stunt multiple times per roll, but if someone opposed your test you can’t expand the effect to anyone with a higher ability + focus total than the original target.                                                                                                                    |
|  3   | **Good Cop/Bad Cop**        | Choose an ally to immediately make a test in seeming opposition to the one you just made, with the same target. If they succeed, rather than garnering the usual results, they prompt the target to give up a secret you didn’t already know.                                                                                                                      |
|  3   | **Let’s Make a Deal**       | Your action turns out to benefit a character you didn’t target, who now owes you a favor, however grudgingly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|  3   | **Objection!**              | You step in on someone else’s behalf. Another character in the scene may use your ability + focus score instead of their own next time they oppose a test during this encounter.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  4   | **Class Clown**             | Your words lighten the mood, imposing a –2 penalty to all enemies’ initiative rolls if a fight breaks out during this encounter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  4   | **Flirt**                   | Roll Communication (Seduction) vs. your target’s Willpower (Self-Discipline) as a simple social roll against a character whose Attitude toward you is Open or better, with a positive bent; if you win, they become enamoured with your character, opening the door to future romance or intimacy. How this proceeds is up to you and the GM to work out together. |
|  4   | **From the Heart**          | You believe wholeheartedly in what you say. Choose one Willpower focus. If you don’t have it already, gain it for the rest of the encounter. If you do, it adds +3 instead of +2 to rolls you make with it.                                                                                                                                                        |
|  4   | **Sleep with One Eye Open** | Applies to a test targeting someone you have a negative Relationship with, or who has harmed someone you have a Relationship with. The next attack you make against that target in this session is automatically a surprise attack, as long as they weren’t already in combat.                                                                                     |
|  5   | **Enrage**                  | Choose one character present whose Attitude toward you is Neutral or worse, or a negative variant of a more positive Attitude. They must immediately either attack you or storm out of the scene. If they attack, it needn’t be deadly, though it can be.                                                                                                          |
|  5   | **Patter**                  | Your rapid-fire words confuse your target, who must succeed at a Perception (Empathy) roll vs. your Communication (Deception), or automatically fail their next non-attack test against you.                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  7   | **My Word is My Bond**      | Applies to a test relevant to completing a task you’ve promised someone you have a Relationship with you’ll perform. Gain +2 to tests directly related to completing this task until the end of the session. This stunt requires bonus SP available from a Relationship in order to meet the necessary cost.                                                       |

|  1   | **Bon Mot**              | You tag the perfect witty remark onto the end of your action. If you can’t think of one, let the group brainstorm and pick one among their ideas. Gain a temporary honorific you can use for passive Reputation only, for the rest of the session.                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  1   | **Stick Your Neck Out**  | Your test puts your own Reputation in jeopardy to help someone else. An ally of your choice gains a +2 bonus to their next social test in this encounter; if they fail, you lose all Reputation bonuses from one honorific for the rest of the session.                                                                                                                                                              |
|  2   | **In Good Standing**     | When targeting a member of an organization in which you have Membership, treat your rank as one higher for purposes of gaining access to resources for the rest of this encounter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  3   | **Benefit of the Doubt** | Your action impresses or charms any one character present. Roll Communications (Persuasion) vs. Willpower (Self-Discipline) to affect someone with an Attitude of Hostile or worse; no roll is necessary for others. Increase all relevant Membership and Reputation bonuses by +1 while interacting with that character for the rest of the session; may improve their Attitude toward you, at the GM’s discretion. |
|  3   | **Go Viral**             | Whether via you or others sharing a video or audio recording, news gets out quickly about what you’ve just done. For the rest of the session, the honorific most related to this test applies even in situations where it seems unrelated.                                                                                                                                                                           |
|  4   | **Oozing Confidence**    | Your action impresses or fools all the right people. Gain one temporary Reputation honorific or rank of Membership for the rest of the session, or until you next fail a test relevant to this influence, whichever comes first.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|  5   | **Name-dropping**        | Your action displays your affiliation with someone whose Membership rank is higher than yours in an organization to which you belong, or who has a relevant honorific you don’t. You may use their Reputation or Membership benefits with that honorific or organization as your own for the rest of the session; if they find out and disapprove, worsen their Attitude toward you by one shift.                    |

| 1-4  | **The Upper Hand**       | During the making contact encounter, you gain a bonus to your initiative test against your target equal to the SP spent (up to +4). This is a version of The Upper Hand exploration stunt unique to bounty hunting.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 2–6  | **What Makes Them Tick** | You get a real sense for your target and what motivates them; for your next social encounter with the target, you gain a bonus to all interaction tests equal to half the SP spent (up to +3 for 6 SP).                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|  5   | **Saw That Coming**      | When you make contact with your target, you can choose one thing that they do in response to you, when it happens, and retroactively declare you had previously prepared for it. So, for example, if the target ducks out the back exit, you can use this stunt to declare you have an ally waiting there for them. The GM approves your choice, and it can only involve resources reasonably at your disposal during the hunt. |

| 1-3  | **“I'm with the band!”** | By telling people you’re a performer and implying—correctly or otherwise—that you are somehow part of the evening’s entertainment, you can get into just about any club, bar, concert hall, theatre, or other entertainment venue immediately and at no cost, even if they’re sold out. This also lets you get backstage, though it doesn’t necessarily grant access to guarded celebrities or restricted areas you have no business visiting (such as server rooms). The cost of this Stunt depends on how plausible your presence is; a grungy Belter musician famous for their hardcore Banger sound would spend 1 to get into a Belter concert venue, but that same musician claiming they’re part of the John Carter Follies musical revival at the Grand Red Opry on Mars would require at least 2 points, and saying they’re with the acclaimed Lunar Ballet production of Senza Peso is definitely going to cost 3 points. Note that the GM has the final say over whether this Stunt is plausible enough to apply to a situation. |
| 1-3  | **Right in the Feels**   | You know how to read your audience and tune your performance for maximum impact. For each point spent on this Stunt, treat the number on the Drama Die as one higher for the purposes of determining the degree of success on a performance roll. Note that this does not change the actual die roll result, only the degree of success when relevant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 1-3  | **Hardball**      | You are adept at asking tough questions and getting honest answers, even if it ruffles some feathers. You may spend SP to impose a -1 penalty on Deception tests for anyone who tries to lie to you during questioning. You may also force an opponent to re-roll a Deception test, but you must abide by this new result, and their Attitude shifts a degree less favourable toward you afterward.                               |
|  2+  | **Fourth Estate** | You temporarily gain a rank of Membership in an organization you’ve been covering or researching, with the rank equal to the SP spent -1. This lasts for the rest of the session. You are not actually a member, but you’ve gained enough trust of those in the organization that as long as you don’t violate their rules, they will take you under their wing for a time.                                                       |
|  3   | **Press Pass**    | By announcing yourself as a member of the press and presenting appropriate credentials, you can gain access to a restricted area or situation where a member of the press might plausibly be admitted (even if it’s unlikely). You probably can’t convince the MCRN to let you waltz onto a battleship currently preparing for battle, for example, but you might be able to get on base to speak to a commander during an alert. |

| 1-3  | **System Damage**  | Your attack damages the vehicle’s Handling, Sensors, or Weapons. Impose a –1 penalty per SP spent to the damaged ability (up to 3). This penalty remains until the vehicle is repaired. Damage control with a TN 13 Intelligence (Engineering) test can negate (but not remove) the penalty for rounds equal to the Drama Die result. If the ability is reduced below –2, the vehicle automatically fails tests calling for it. If Handling is reduced below –2 the vehicle is out of control and helpless. |
|  1+  | **Penetrate Hull** | Your attack overcomes the vehicle’s resistance to damage. If a vehicle has a Hull rating, you must spend SP equal to it on this stunt before spending SP on other stunts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  2   | **Off-Course**     | The vehicle is thrown off-course and the operator must make a TN 15 test to maintain control. A new test can be made each round to regain control if it is lost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  2   | **Scuttle**        | Your attack destroys the target vehicle. This stunt is only available against a helpless vehicle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|  2+  | **Shrapnel**       | The attack causes a damaging explosion in the vehicle’s interior. The operator and all passengers in the same compartment suffer 1d6 damage for 2 SP or 2d6 damage for 4 SP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|  3+  | **Hull Breach**    | You inflict significant damage to the vehicle, reducing its Hull rating by 1 per 3 SP spent. The loss of Hull rating lasts until repaired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|  3   | **Slowdown**       | You damage the vehicle’s propulsion, dropping its Speed class by one category. If it drops to Slow or less, the operator must make a TN 15 test to maintain control. The slowdown remains until repaired. Damage control with a TN 13 Intelligence (Engineering) test can negate (but not remove) the penalty for rounds equal to the Drama Die result.                                                                                                                                                     |
|  4   | **Disable Drive**  | Your attack disables the vehicle’s propulsion. The operator must make a TN 15 test to maintain control and, even if they succeed, must deal with a vehicle that can no longer move or maneuver under its own power. The vehicle is helpless. Damage control with a TN 13 Intelligence (Engineering) test can restore the vehicle’s Speed at one degree lower than usual for rounds equal to the Drama Die result.                                                                                           |
|  4+  | **Skewer**         | Your attack is in just the right place to do serious damage inside the vehicle: One character suffers 4d6 damage for 4 SP, or 6d6 damage for 6 SP, or the full damage of your weapon +2d6, whichever is less.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|  5   | **Rupture**        | Your attack ruptures a fuel line or power conduit, causing an internal explosion. This deals 3d6 penetrating damage to everyone in a particular compartment of the vehicle and also causes the effects of either a System Damage (3 SP) or Slowdown stunt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|  6   | **Disable Engine** | Your attack disables the vehicle’s engine or main power, such as a ship’s reactor, causing the effect of a Disable Drive stunt and leaving the vehicle completely without power other than emergency back-ups and essentially helpless. Damage control with a TN 13 Intelligence (Engineering) test can restore power for rounds equal to the Drama Die result. Otherwise the power remains offline until repaired.                                                                                         |

|  4   | **Skimming**           | If a space battle takes place near a planet with an atmosphere, you can dive into the planet’s atmosphere to avoid being targeted and perhaps even lose your pursuer completely.<br><br>Your pilot must make an opposed TN 17 Dexterity (Piloting) test to succeed:<br>Success -> the pursuing ship loses track of your ship in the atmosphere, at least temporarily.<br><br>On following rounds, the pursuing ship can make opposed TN 11 Intelligence (Technology) + Sensors tests to reacquire a target on your ship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  4   | **Too Close**          | To perform this stunt, you must be engaged against multiple enemy ships and at close range to one that is of at least one size class larger. A space station can also count as a larger ship.<br><br>The pilot manoeuvres into a position that makes it difficult for enemies to target your ship without risking damage to the other ship.<br><br>During the Manoeuvre phase, the pilot must make a successful opposed TN 15 Dexterity (Piloting) test against the larger ship at -2. <br><br>The difficulty is reduced by 1 for every additional size class greater the enemy ship is than the crew’s ship:<br>- Success à the pilot gains a+2 to their evasion test against any ships other than the ship they are using for cover<br>- Any attacks that miss the crew’s ship hit the larger ship if the pilot rolls a 5 or 6 on the Drama Die.<br>- If both ships fail the piloting test à the ships collide, causing 2d6 damage to the larger ship and 4d6 damage to the smaller ship.                                                                                                                                                |
|  4+  | **Set-Up**             | You manoeuvre an opposing ship into a hazard, such as a normally shorter range weapon, a field of debris, or even a floating rock. This stunt is considered a **weapon attack** inflicting damage dice equal to half the SP spent (round down). The Set-Up can be evaded; the TN is 10 + your Intelligence + Leadership focus (if any) + half the SP spent. So if a character with Intelligence 2 and Leadership spends 5 SP on this stunt, the TN to evade the Set-Up is (10 + 2 + 2 + 2.5, rounded down to 2) or 16, and a failure on the evasion test results in 2d6 damage to the target ship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|  5   | **Burn Them**          | An Epstein drive emits a powerful drive plume that can, in a pinch, be used as a weapon. To do this successfully, the ship must be at close range and perform a sudden flip and burn that points the drive plume directly at the enemy ship.<br><br>The ships must be at extremely close range, so this manoeuvre can’t be used in normal engagements - only if circumstances have dictated that the ships are very close (under 1 km). Unfortunately, this manoeuvre leaves the crew’s ship vulnerable and open to attack.<br><br>To successfully perform this manoeuvre, the pilot must also make a successful opposed TN 19 Dexterity (Piloting) test against the other ship at -2. If successful, the other ship is engulfed in your drive plume, causing 6d6 damage. The downside is that only rear-facing weapons can fire while the ship performs this manoeuvre, and enemy ships have a +2 to their evasion tests. Also, due to being in an exposed position, all evasion tests are at -2. If the pilot fails this test, they fail to engulf the enemy ship with the drive plume but still suffer all of the associated penalties. |
|  5   | **Weapon Online**      | One of the crew can temporarily bring a damaged weapon, or a weapon that has run out of ammo, back online.<br><br>A character can attempt a TN 14 Intelligence (Engineering) or Dexterity (Gunnery) test to bring a weapon back online.<br><br>The weapon can make 1d3 shots before giving up the ghost for good, requiring a proper repair. The weapon cannot be brought back online again without the ship receiving full maintenance at a spaceport.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|  4   | **Blockade**           | The pilot manoeuvres the ship to make it difficult for an enemy ship to fire on or pursue its chosen target (unless that target is the pilot’s ship).<br><br>The enemy ship suffers a -2 penalty to any manoeuvre test to pursue or attack its original target. Or the targeted ship gets a +2 to its evasion test.                                          |
|  4+  | **Set-up**             | You manoeuvre an opposing ship into a hazard, such as a normally shorter-range weapon, a field of debris, or even a floating rock.<br><br>This stunt is considered a weapon attack inflicting damage dice equal to half the SP spent (round down).<br><br>Can be evaded with the TN = 10 + your Intelligence + Leadership focus (if any) + half the SP spent |

|  2+  | **Turnabout is Fair Play** | If a torpedo is being manually controlled, the sensors operator can attempt to wrest control of the torpedo from the other ship. If there is more than one torpedo, 2 SP can be spent to attempt to control each.<br><br>Opposed Intelligence (Technology) + Sensors test against the enemy ship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|  3   | **Exploitable Terrain**    | If you are near appropriate exploitable terrain (asteroid field, dust cloud), you spot a path near or through it that the pilot (whether you or another character) can use as protective cover. Immediately trigger either the Evasive Manoeuvre or Follow the Leader chase stunt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

|  4   | **Hack the System**        | While scanning the enemy ship for weaknesses, the sensors operator detects an opening in the enemy ship’s computer system. They can attempt to hack the enemy’s ship to temporarily disable one or more systems. To do this, a PC must make an opposed Intelligence (Technology) + Sensors test against the enemy ship. If successful, they can shut down one system on that ship (weapons, sensors, engines, etc.). They remain offline until someone on the enemy ship makes a successful TN 15 Intelligence (Technology) test. |
