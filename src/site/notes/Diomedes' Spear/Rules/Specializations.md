| Requirement | Intelligence 2 or higher and the Intelligence (Research) focus.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Novice      | You have a real skill in not only finding facts, but knowing where to look. If you fail an Intelligence (Research) test, you can re-roll it, but must keep the result of the second roll.                                                                           |
| Expert      | You have become adept at recalling relevant information. When you perform the A-Ha! stunt, you gain one free extra use of it; that is, if you spend 1 SP, you can perform the stunt twice, if you spend 2 SP, you can use it three times, and so on.                |
| Master      | Your fact-finding abilities are unparalleled. When you make an Intelligence (Research) test as part of an advanced test, you gain a +1 bonus to the result of each Drama Die. This increases your total roll, and allows you to reach the success threshold faster. |

| Novice      | You can coax more out of your ship than most. When you perform the Punch It chase stunt, you gain an extra +1 bonus on your next chase test, above the bonus gained for the stunt (so the bonus is +2 when you spend 1 SP, +3 when you spend 2 SP and so on). |
| Expert      | Add +2 to the Drama Die when making tests using the Dexterity (Piloting) focus.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Master      | You are a peerless pilot. Add +1 to tests made using Dexterity (Piloting) and you may re-roll a failed test, although you don’t get the bonus on the re-roll and must take the result of the second roll.                                                     |

| Novice      | You built your life on lies. If you fail a Communication (Deception) test, you can re-roll it, but must keep the result of the second roll.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Expert      | You are also adept at seeing through deception. When you use the Read the Room stunt, add +3 to your Perception (Empathy) roll when the stunt is opposed.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Master      | You are a masterful spy. You gain two of the following focuses if you don’t have them already: Communication (Disguise), Communication (Investigation), Dexterity (Stealth), Intelligence (Cryptography), and Intelligence (Security). If you already have all of these, pick two and add +1 to all rolls made using them. |

| Novice      | You can designate someone or something as your “quarry” after spending at least an hour on the job investigating them, including reading a prepared brief or dossier. You can only have one active quarry at a time but can substitute a new quarry for a previous one with an additional time investment. Usually, your quarry is the focus of the bounty you’re currently pursuing. You’re considered to always have the tangential focus necessary to investigate your quarry, and if you have the primary or tangential focus, you gain a +1 bonus on your tests to investigate them. You also gain the benefits of the Dexterity (Initiative) and Perception (Intuition) focuses |
| Expert      | You can prepare a major action in relation to your quarry. Whenever you roll initiative against your quarry, you can perform your prepared action first before your quarry acts regardless of the initiative order; you then take your normal actions on your turn. Prepared actions may include things like a Run or Charge towards your quarry, an Attack against them, and attempt to hide from them, or a Stunt Attack directed at them. You can choose your prepared action up to when initiative is rolled. Once action time begins, however, it can’t be changed; you can either take the prepared action or choose not to—if circumstances allow.                             |
| Master      | When you surprise your quarry, you are automatically considered to have them dead-to-rights. You have a +2 bonus for any tests to see if you surprise your quarry. This is in addition to any bonuses from ability focuses or your Novice ability for this specialization. Also, if you fail an ability test to unlock a clue related to your quarry, you can re-roll the test and use the result of the second roll instead                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

At this degree, you gain an intensity 1 Relationship with your team, whoever that may be, and you keep the relationship even if the membership of your team changes. You can increase the intensity of this Relationship normally. See the Rewards chapter for details on Relationships.             |
| Master      | You can overcome the effects of some conditions through sheer grit. When you acquire the exhausted, fatigued, injured, or wounded conditions, make a TN 13 Constitution (Stamina) or Willpower (Self Discipline) test; if you succeed, you ignore the effects of the condition for the remainder of the encounter, although the condition itself remains. |

| Novice      | You’ve got some raw potential, and you’re starting to learn how to experiment with it. Sometimes that blows up in your face, but sometimes it finds brilliance in what was otherwise an average work of art. Whenever you roll a test to create or perform art, you may choose to re-roll the attempt but must keep the new roll even if it’s worse. In addition, you should explain how a success transforms a performance that wasn’t going well or how a failure results in a promising piece going off the rails.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Expert      | You have developed a signature style, possibly even a signature piece such as a custom instrument or beloved persona, and it’s something with which audiences strongly connect. Talk to the GM to develop a clear idea of what this entails, but it should be fairly narrow— “making music” is not a valid signature since it could apply to almost any test for a musician, but “playing daggri-punk” or “my drag persona Miss Fifi Fofum” would both be acceptable since they are specific as to when they apply. Whenever you create using your signature, you can choose to either gain a +2 on the subsequent Income test or reduce the cost of Stunts while using it by 1 SP (minimum 1). |
| Master      | Your art is a part of you, and even those who aren’t familiar with your medium can tell right away that you have a gift for it. You make the most challenging artistic feats look easy and attempt things other artists can’t even dream of doing. Reduce the Test Difficulty by one category for all tests related to artistic creation and performance or by two categories if you can feature your signature. In addition, if the Drama Die is lower than 3 on a performance roll related to your art, treat it as though you rolled a 3 in terms of degrees of success. This can be further modified with the Right in the Feels Stunt.                                                     |

| Novice      | You have experience in negotiating the byways of your organization. You acquire a Membership in a new organization or advance to the next rank with an existing Membership (see the Rewards chapter for details on Memberships). You can re-roll any test to access privileges from, or influence members of, the organization behind this acquired or improved Member ship, but must keep the results of the second roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Expert      | Your authority extends to calling in a subordinate to support you. Once per day you may make a Communication (Persuasion) test. If you succeed, you can call in a subordinate from the organization you chose at the Novice rank to aid you. Use one of the profiles found in the Threats chapter. If your character is level 5-8, this subordinate can be no more than a Minor threat, called at a test TN of 11. If your character is level 9-12, you may choose a Moderate-threat subordinate instead, at a test TN of 13. If your character is level 13 or above, you have the option of a subordinate who’s a Major threat in their own right, if you succeed at a TN 15 test. You do not gain the novice re-roll benefit on this test. |
| Master      | Because you have influence in your organization, you have constant access to resources. Add your Membership rank in the organization to your Income whenever you can call upon your organization. Further more, if your Income score decreases, you regain the lost point during the next interlude when you interact with the organization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Novice      | Your accuracy is instinctive. Pick Accuracy (Pistols) or Accuracy (Rifles). You gain a +1 to attack and damage rolls for attacks made using your chosen focus.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Expert      | You’re fast and precise. You may pick the other focus from the Novice degree and apply the Novice benefit to it, or improve the bonus for the focus you picked at Novice rank to +2 to your attack and damage rolls.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Master      | You’re one with the gun. Choose one of the following stunts: Lightning Attack, Overwatch, Lethal Blow, or Wound. You can perform the chosen stunt for 1 SP less than usual when wielding a firearm. In the case of Overwatch, spending 1 SP gives you the effects of spending 2 SP, and spending 2 SP gives you the 3 SP effect. See Chapter 5 for details on these stunts. |

Add +1 to Intelligence (Technology) tests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Expert      | When things go wrong or don’t work quite how you want them to, you’re skilled in finding backdoors and loopholes. You can perform the High Tech Hustle stunt for 2 SP. In advanced tests involving computer systems, add +1 to your Drama Die roll. This increases your total test result and allows you to complete advanced tests faster. |
| Master      | Breaking into a system is one thing, but getting in and then out without getting caught is another. While using a computer system, you may perform the Cover Your Tracks stunt for 1 SP. Add another +1 to your Drama Die result while performing advanced tests for a total of +2, otherwise the same as the Expert degree benefit.        |

| Novice      | You can always make a test to unlock a lead, even if you don’t have a primary or tangential focus relevant to the investigation, although you take a +2 increase in TN when you don’t have either (see Investigation in Chapter 5 for details). If you do have a primary or tangential focus for the lead, you get a +1 bonus to the test with a primary focus (in addition to the focus bonus) and no increase in TN for using a tangential focus. |
| Expert      | The real trick to being a great investigator isn’t finding clues, it’s knowing how to use them. You may use the Intuition stunt for 1 SP. Furthermore, if you have the primary focus required to unlock a lead, add another +1 to your roll to do so for a total of +2.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Master      | When all the evidence is gathered, you only need a flash of inspiration to put it together and find the solution. You can use the Breakthrough stunt on an investigation for only 3 SP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Novice      | You’ve learned to use your status as a journalist to get your foot in the door both literally and figuratively. Whenever you use the Press Pass stunt success fully to gain access to a situation, gain +2 to your next social test directly related to conducting journalistic activity.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Expert      | You’ve developed a few specific techniques as part of your journalistic arsenal. Select three stunts from the General Social Stunts list in The Expanse RPG— halve the SP cost of these stunts, rounded up (minimum 1). This reduction only applies when you’re using a stunt as part of your journalistic work; while they’re encouraged to give it a fair amount of latitude, the GM has the final say on whether it applies to a particular situation. |
| Master      | You’ve got a knack for finding the right angle to make a story catch on and have developed enough of an audience following to get it started. Once per session, you may use the Go Viral stunt for free, provided you have some way of broadcasting the relevant events.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
