## Income Test
To purchase an item, make an Income test against the item’s cost.

A **3d6** roll plus your **current Income score**. 
- test result >=  the cost -> successful
- test result < the cost -> fail
### Automatic success
Income score + 4 >= cost -> automatic success
### Resource depletion
Successfully purchase something with a cost > Income score + 10 -> Income score decreases by 1.
### Try again
You may be able to try again if you fail an Income test, but not until you have spent an additional number of hours equal to the cost of the item “shopping around” and looking for other options and venues.
### Material Support
One character can help another to buy something, so long as the assisting character’s Income is equal to or greater than that of the purchasing character.

In this case, you provide the other person with a +2 bonus on the Income test to buy that item. If the item’s cost is above your current Income score +10, you also deplete your Income to reflect the financial assistance you’ve given.
## Gaining Income
Granted by GM as part of plot. Generally a +1 increase, but can be +2.
## Pooling Income
Use for a permanent arrangement. 

Shared income score = highest player score - 1
If all score are equal, then it is that score.

Splitting pool -> each player gets pool score - 1

## Selling items
### Legally
Determine the item’s cost.
The item’s value is equal to its cost minus 1. 
Consider players income:
- Item value - player income > 6 -> player income +2
- Item value - player income -> player income + 1
### Illegal
Selling something illegally reduces its value by an additional 1 (so cost –2) and the GM may require a Communication (Bargaining) test to avoid the notice of the authorities.
