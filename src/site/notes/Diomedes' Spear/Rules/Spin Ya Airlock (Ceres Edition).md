A popular dice gambling game in the backrooms of Ceres' casinos, _Spin the Airlock_ is a fast-paced, high-risk game where players try to outroll—and outbluff—their opponents. Unlike its underground Belt version, the Ceres casino variant includes a structured betting system and a house edge, making it a staple of the gambling scene in the station's bustling concourses.

## Requirements
- 3 six-sided dice (d6) per player
- A casino table with a dealer (the "Dockmaster")
- Betting chips (or digital credits)
- 2-5 players per table

---
## Setup

1. The Buy-In: Players must exchange credits for chips before playing. The table has a minimum and maximum bet per round.
2. The Ante: All players place the required ante before rolling.

---
## Gameplay
1. The Roll ("Spin Ya Dice") : Each player rolls three d6s in secret. The Dockmaster rolls as well, representing "The House."
2. The Betting Round ("Push Ya Luck"): Players decides whether to:
    - Hold da Pressure (Staying in with the minimum bet)
    - Crank da Lock (Raising the bet)
    - Vent da Lock (Folding and losing their ante)
3. The Reveal ("Open da Door"): Once all bets are settled, remaining players reveal their dice.

---
## Winning Hands (Highest to Lowest)
1. Triple Sixes ("Deep Black") – An instant win unless another player ties (then the pot carries over to the next round).
2. Three-of-a-Kind ("Kakka Lucky") – Any three matching numbers (higher sets beat lower).
3. Straight ("Smooth Burn") – Any three sequential numbers (1-2-3 is lowest, 4-5-6 highest).
4. Two-of-a-Kind ("Leaky Seal") – Two matching dice; the third die acts as a tiebreaker.
5. House Roll ("Ceres Syndicate") – If no players have a ranked hand, the House wins by default.

---
## The House Rules
- The House (Dockmaster) rolls against all remaining players. If a player’s hand beats the House’s, they win based on payout odds (see below).
- If the House wins, all bets are lost to the House.
- If a player ties with the House, the bet is pushed (player keeps their bet but gains nothing).
