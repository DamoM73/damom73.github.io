| Planning     | **Planning**  <br>A commander may spend their turn banking SP toward a specific stunt or combo of stunts. To do so, they declare the intended stunt(s) and make a TN 13 Intelligence (Tactics) test. On success, they store 2 SP—or the drama die result if doubles are rolled—for future use.<br><br>Banked SP cannot be used in the same round and must be spent in a later round. A commander may repeat the test in later rounds to accumulate enough SP for the declared stunt(s).<br><br>Planning must target a specific stunt cost and cannot be used to simply enhance stunts like _Guidance_ or _Evasive Action_. |

| 1+     | Combined Fire | You coordinate fire with an allied ship, increasing the likelihood that both of you hit the target. Every 1 SP you spend increases the TN of tests made to evade your ship’s attack by +1. Both captains must spend this SP |
| 2+     | Draw Fire     | You manage to draw fire from an enemy’s intended target. For every 2 SP spent, an attacker that was going to attack an ally attacks your ship instead                                                                       |
| 2+     | Good Advice   | This stunt allows one commander to aid another, either by giving them a bonus to their next command test or giving them SP. Every 2 SP you spend gives an allied Commander +1 on their next test or 1 SP to spend           |

| **Step 6: Damage Control**         |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Damage control roll                | Loss off Manoeuvrability, Sensors, or Weapons can be eliminated with a damage control advanced test:<br>- Intelligence (Engineering) vs. TN 11<br>- success threshold is 5 for every loss on that system |
| Restore offline reactor or weapons | Temporarily restore offline system<br>- TN 13 basic Intelligence (Engineering) test<br>- restores system for a number of rounds equal to the Drama Die                                                   |

####  Damage Control Stunts

| ------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1+     | Not My Ship!  | The Engineer can spend Fortune to reduce damage taken by the ship just as it were part of the hull. For every SP spent on this stunt, the engineer can spend 1d6 Fortune to reduce damage                                                                                                    |
| 1+     | Eye Patch     | Reduce the TN of a damage control test to repair a loss to Sensors by 1 for each SP spent                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 3+     | Quick Fix     | Every 3 SP spent allows the engineer to instantly repair a single loss to Manoeuvrability, Sensors, or Weapons.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 4      | Patch         | The engineer makes a TN 17 Intelligence (Engineering) test to apply a temporary hull repair.<br>- Success: Restore hull equal to the engineer’s Drama Die roll.<br>- The patch lasts until the end of combat, after which proper maintenance is required.                                    |
| 5      | Weapon Online | A crew member can temporarily restore a damaged or depleted weapon.<br><br>Make a TN 14 Intelligence (Engineering) or Dexterity (Gunnery) test. Success: The weapon functions for 1d3 shots, then fails permanently until full maintenance is performed at a spaceport.                      |
| 6      | Quick Start   | The crew can attempt to make a quick repair and restart the ship’s reactor.<br><br>This requires two characters to work together; one must make a TN 14 Intelligence (Technology) test and another must make a TN 14 Intelligence (Engineering) test, and they must reach a threshold of 15. |
