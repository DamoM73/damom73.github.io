| 3        | Electronic Warfare<br>_Comms Officer_                 | Determine the effectiveness of the ship’s sensor information and any efforts to deceive enemy sensors, and therefore targeting, using electronic warfare techniques.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Planning     | Allows a commander to spend the round setting up a future stunt by allowing them to save SP toward a specific goal.<br><br>To attempt a plan, the commander must declare the stunt (or combination of stunts) they are working toward and make a TN 13 Intelligence (Tactics) test. Instead of spending any stunt points earned, they are banked and can be used in a future round. Success grants 2 SP or the result of the drama die if doubles are rolled.<br><br>These SP cannot be used on the same round and must be held until the next (or later) round. A commander can continue making this test until they have enough SP for the desired stunt.<br><br>Planning cannot be used simply to increase the effectiveness of a specific stunt, such as Guidance or Evasive Action, but can only be spent building toward a stunt with a specific cost. |

| 5      | Burn Them          | An Epstein drive emits a powerful drive plume that can, in a pinch, be used as a weapon. To do this successfully, the ship must be at close range and perform a sudden flip and burn that points the drive plume directly at the enemy ship.<br><br>The ships must be at extremely close range, so this manoeuvre can’t be used in normal engagements - only if circumstances have dictated that the ships are very close (under 1 km). Unfortunately, this manoeuvre leaves the crew’s ship vulnerable and open to attack.<br><br>To successfully perform this manoeuvre, the pilot must also make a successful opposed TN 19 Dexterity (Piloting) test against the other ship at -2. If successful, the other ship is engulfed in your drive plume, causing 6d6 damage. The downside is that only rear-facing weapons can fire while the ship performs this manoeuvre, and enemy ships have a +2 to their evasion tests. Also, due to being in an exposed position, all evasion tests are at -2. If the pilot fails this test, they fail to engulf the enemy ship with the drive plume but still suffer all of the associated penalties. |     |

| 1+     | Not My Ship!  | The Engineer can spend Fortune to reduce damage taken by the ship just as it were part of the hull. For every SP spent on this stunt, the engineer can spend 1d6 Fortune to reduce damage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 3+     | Quick Fix     | Every 3 SP spent allows the engineer to instantly repair a single loss to Manoeuvrability, Sensors, or Weapons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 4      | Patch         | The ship’s engineer can apply a quick weld job to temporarily reinforce hull damage. Attempt a TN 17 Intelligence (Engineering) test to make the patch. If successful, the temporarily remove hull losses up to the number rolled on the Drama Die by the engineer. This patch only lasts until the end of the combat, and the ship must then receive proper maintenance at a spaceport.                                                                |
| 5      | Weapon Online | One of the crew can temporarily bring a damaged weapon, or a weapon that has run out of ammo, back online.<br><br>A character can attempt a TN 14 Intelligence (Engineering) or Dexterity (Gunnery) test to bring a weapon back online.<br><br>The weapon can make 1d3 shots before giving up the ghost for good, requiring a proper repair. The weapon cannot be brought back online again without the ship receiving full maintenance at a spaceport. |
| 6      | Quick Start   | The crew can attempt to make a quick repair and restart the ship’s reactor.<br><br>This requires two characters to work together; one must make a TN 14 Intelligence (Technology) test and another must make a TN 14 Intelligence (Engineering) test, and they must reach a threshold of 15.                                                                                                                                                            |
