Honorifics are titles or nicknames that a character or a ship earns, representing their reputation within the world of The Expanse Roleplaying Game . They are a form of reward that characters gain for their deeds, or even simply due to rumours about them.

## Purpose and Nature

- Public Standing: Honorifics measure a character's or ship's public standing . For bounty hunters, reputation is crucial for attracting clients, while a poor reputation can make finding work difficult. Similarly, a planetary surveyor's or scout's reputation affects job offers, and for traders and smugglers, reputation is their "lifeblood", influencing access to legitimate or high-risk jobs. An Entertainer can have VIP Access for their ship due to their celebrity status, reducing fees and repair times.
- Influence and Access: They can be leveraged to smooth social interactions or gain access to resources and opportunities otherwise out of reach. For example, a journalist's press identifier broadcasts their credentials, flagging them as a non-combatant and reducing their chances of arrest or being shot.
- Situational: Honorifics are potent but situational. A champion athlete's fame in sports may not help in a political debate unless directly related. The GM has the final say on when an honorific applies mechanically.
- Dynamic: They are rarely permanent and can fade or change based on conflicting evidence or new actions. They don't even need to be entirely deserved or true.

## Gaining and Losing Honorifics

- Acquisition: Honorifics usually arise from a character's actions in play. Characters can choose a reputation (honorific) as an improvement from their character's drive during creation.
- Maintenance/Change: Characters can spend time during interludes performing the "Reputation" activity to bolster, diminish, or create a new honorific. This often involves making their actions known, such as giving interviews or broadcasting videos. The GM decides when a character has done enough to gain or lose a specific reputation; System-wide notoriety might require more than a few interludes to influence .
- Ability Test (Optional): A Game Master may require a Communication (Expression or Performing) test to measure the effectiveness of efforts to influence reputation.

## Types of Honorifics and their Mechanical Effects

Honorifics provide mechanical benefits, often tied to ability tests. Conversely, bad reputations reverse these benefits into penalties, and can be eliminated through "Reputation" interlude activities.

1. Personal Reputation: When a character invokes their honorific (or the story of how they gained it), opponents suffer a -1 penalty on opposed tests against them, particularly when the test involves the character's famed skill or natural ability.
    - _Bad Personal Reputation_: Opponents gain a +1 bonus on opposed tests.
2. Supportive Reputation: When others (friends or foes) talk up a character's title, the character gains a +2 bonus to rolls demonstrating their known abilities in that scene.
    - _Bad Supportive Reputation_: Relevant test target numbers increase by +2 for the character.
3. Inspired Reputation: Using an honorific outside its typical field (an "inspired purpose") grants a +1 bonus to the Drama Die result when the player demonstrates clever use of the honorific for an aim.
    - _Bad Inspired Reputation_: Tests in relevant areas suffer a -1 penalty to the stunt points generated on the Drama Die.
4. Passive Reputation: In social situations where a group or individual is aware of the reputation, the character benefits from a free, single-step attitude shift (positive or negative) in the direction suited to their reputation.
    - _Bad Passive Reputation_: Tends to worsen attitudes and can lead to increased scrutiny from authorities.

## Reputation Spread (RS)
The impact of a reputation is only meaningful if others have heard of it. Reputation Spread is a dynamic rating (0–5) that tracks how far your reputation has travelled across the system. 

| RS  | Spread Level | Description                                                                      |
| --- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0   | Unknown      | Only your crew and direct contacts know of your actions. No mechanical effect.   |
| 1   | Local        | Known within a station or small cluster (e.g., Ceres or Tycho).                  |
| 2   | Regional     | Talked about across an orbit (e.g., Belt or Inner Mars stations).                |
| 3   | Systemic     | Whispers about your name float through multiple planetary zones.                 |
| 4   | Factional    | Major factions track you, and your name is recognized by agents and contractors. |
| 5   | Legendary    | Your name is known across the entire system—loved, feared, or both.              |

## Ship Honorifics
Ships, like characters, can also gain reputations and honorifics based on their history and their crew's collective actions. These can inspire respect or fear.

- Ship honorifics have the same four categories (Personal, Supportive, Inspired, Passive) with similar mechanical effects as character honorifics.
- Some ship honorifics are historical facts, like a former name or captain, which might provide narrative flavour but no mechanical benefit or even a detriment.

## Examples of Honorifics

- Destined for Greatness: Character succeeds beyond expectations, creating rivals.
