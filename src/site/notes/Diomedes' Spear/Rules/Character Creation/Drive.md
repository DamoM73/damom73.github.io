## Achiever
You want to accomplish things, ideally lasting things for which you will be recognized. Some achievers want success, fame, and accolades, while others are looking to leave a legacy, something for which they will be remembered. But all achievers are keenly aware that life is short and everyone has the same number of hours in a day; it’s how you spend them that matters.

## Builder
You want to create something lasting. It might be an institution, an organization, a movement, a community, or some thing else. Unlike the Achiever, who is all about the accomplishment, you’re all about the end product, and willing to do what it takes, for as long as it takes, to get there.

| Attribute   | Details                                                                          |

## Caregiver
You’re here to help as many people as you can, however you can. You might not be able to help everyone, but you are certainly going to try, and you have a difficult time turning away from anyone in need.

| Attribute   | Details                                                                                              |

## Ecstatic
Life is a banquet and most poor suckers are starving to death! Not you, though You aim to squeeze every drop of juice out of your limited time in this world, and you generally encourage your friends to join you, although you’re willing to go off on your own if none of them do.

## Leader
Somebody needs to stand up, take responsibility, and get things done. You might relish the opportunity to lead or take it up reluctantly, but either way, you’re a natural at it and it’s hard to resist an opportunity to take charge.

## Penitent
You screwed up. Maybe you didn’t mean to, or maybe you did and should have known better. Whatever the case, you’re trying to make it right now by doing better. You may or may not want anyone else to know about your past mistakes, but what happens next is what really matters.

## Protector
There are a lot of threats out in the world, and you are going to guard against them. Exactly what you consider a threat, and who or what you are protecting from it, might vary but the most important thing is you are not going to stand idly by when you could act.

## Rebel
Authority needs to be questioned. You may think all forms of authority are inherently oppressive and need to be brought down, or just that healthy institutions require peri odic house-cleanings—or purging fires. Whatever the case, you threw out doing things “by the book” some time ago.

| Downfall    | **Zealotry**. Your vision becomes confused with absolute truth, which might lead you to offer it where it is unwelcome or to try and eliminate other visions you see as false or competition. Alternatively, your downfall is **Doubt**, where you experience a crisis of faith and are uncertain how to follow your vision—or if you should continue to follow it at all. |
