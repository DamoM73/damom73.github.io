In The Expanse Roleplaying Game, character bonds are a crucial aspect of interpersonal connections, representing the intimate ties that form between Player Characters (PCs) and even between PCs and their ship. These relationships can be deliberately developed or arise from circumstances.

## Nature of the Bond (Relationship Bond)
- The "Relationship Bond" defines the specific nature of the connection between characters, such as friendship, animosity, or romance.
- Bonds can range from straightforward to highly complex.
- Examples of such bonds include statements like: "I would risk my life for you," "I won't stop until you are dead," "We've gone through hell together," "I trust you to be my conscience," and "You are someone I love and respect, but we can never be together in the way I want".
- Both the Game Master (GM) and players should understand the foundation of a Bond and track its evolution over time.

## Strength of the Bond (Relationship Intensity)
    
- Beyond its nature, a bond also has an Intensity rating, from 1 to 5, which signifies its strength .
- An Intensity of 1 denotes a new but significant relationship, while an Intensity of 5 represents a profound, once-in-a-lifetime connection.
- Mechanical Benefit: For each rank of Intensity, a character receives a free stunt point (SP) at the start of each game session. These SP can _only_ be used for stunts that directly involve or are connected to the relationship, and can only be spent once per session. They can be combined with SP generated from rolling doubles.

## Formation and Evolution of Bonds
- Ideally, relationships and bonds should form organically during play, developing from character interactions.
- During character creation, players can establish initial connections by choosing "Ties" to other group members, promoting early group cohesion.
- Characters can actively work to forge new bonds or modify existing ones by performing the "Relating" interlude activity. This activity requires time and a willing participant, or circumstances that necessitate it.
- Intensity can change over time, waxing or waning. Players and GMs should review relationships when a character gains a level to decide if the Bond type or Intensity shifts. Increasing Intensity by one step typically requires a number of interludes equal to the desired Intensity level.

## Ship Bonds
    
- Beyond character-to-character relationships, ships can also form bonds with their crew members. This is often a deeply personal and absolute connection, as the crew relies on the ship for survival in space.
- Like character relationships, Ship Bonds are described from the character's perspective and guide the tone of their interactions with the vessel.
- Ship Bonds also have an Intensity rating (1 to 5), with each rank granting a free stunt point exclusively for stunts related to the ship.
- These bonds can be increased or forged by undertaking "Maintenance" or "Making or Fixing" activities during an interlude, or by crews spending time "Relating" on the ship.
- While Ship Bond Intensity can decrease if a character spends a significant amount of time away from the vessel, it can never drop below 1 unless the ship is destroyed.
