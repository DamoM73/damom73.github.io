		"content": "A Campaign for The Expanse RPG\n“The Belt bleeds, and the Inners sip champagne on Titan.”\nSix months have passed since Eros burned across the system and plunged into Venus. The stars haven’t looked right since.\nThe UN and the MCRN point guns at each other while retreating from their outposts in the Belt, leaving behind a power vacuum—and an opportunity. On Ceres, Anderson Dawes is calling for Belters to stand for themselves, to protect their own from pirates, criminals, and the vultures that circle in corporate suits.\nYou are a crew of freelancers, survivors, and exiles drawn into a fragile alliance under Dawes’ watchful eye. You’ve been asked to do what the Inners never would: look after your own. Enforce justice in a place where the laws are written in dust. You’ll root out smugglers, uncover hidden agendas, and tangle with black-budget ghosts that should have stayed buried.\nAnd somewhere in the dark, something is stirring—something colder than vacuum, and older than Mars.\nThis is Diomedes’ Spear—a story of loyalty, betrayal, and survival in a solar system coming apart at the seams.\nBuckle in, tolowda. Time to choose who you bleed for.",

		"content": "In The Expanse Roleplaying Game, character bonds are a crucial aspect of interpersonal connections, representing the intimate ties that form between Player Characters (PCs) and even between PCs and their ship. These relationships can be deliberately developed or arise from circumstances.\nNature of the Bond (Relationship Bond)\n\nThe &quot;Relationship Bond&quot; defines the specific nature of the connection between characters, such as friendship, animosity, or romance.\nBonds can range from straightforward to highly complex.\nExamples of such bonds include statements like: &quot;I would risk my life for you,&quot; &quot;I won't stop until you are dead,&quot; &quot;We've gone through hell together,&quot; &quot;I trust you to be my conscience,&quot; and &quot;You are someone I love and respect, but we can never be together in the way I want&quot;.\nBoth the Game Master (GM) and players should understand the foundation of a Bond and track its evolution over time.\n\nStrength of the Bond (Relationship Intensity)\n\nBeyond its nature, a bond also has an Intensity rating, from 1 to 5, which signifies its strength .\nAn Intensity of 1 denotes a new but significant relationship, while an Intensity of 5 represents a profound, once-in-a-lifetime connection.\nMechanical Benefit: For each rank of Intensity, a character receives a free stunt point (SP) at the start of each game session. These SP can only be used for stunts that directly involve or are connected to the relationship, and can only be spent once per session. They can be combined with SP generated from rolling doubles.\n\nFormation and Evolution of Bonds\n\nIdeally, relationships and bonds should form organically during play, developing from character interactions.\nDuring character creation, players can establish initial connections by choosing &quot;Ties&quot; to other group members, promoting early group cohesion.\nCharacters can actively work to forge new bonds or modify existing ones by performing the &quot;Relating&quot; interlude activity. This activity requires time and a willing participant, or circumstances that necessitate it.\nIntensity can change over time, waxing or waning. Players and GMs should review relationships when a character gains a level to decide if the Bond type or Intensity shifts. Increasing Intensity by one step typically requires a number of interludes equal to the desired Intensity level.\n\nShip Bonds\n\nBeyond character-to-character relationships, ships can also form bonds with their crew members. This is often a deeply personal and absolute connection, as the crew relies on the ship for survival in space.\nLike character relationships, Ship Bonds are described from the character's perspective and guide the tone of their interactions with the vessel.\nShip Bonds also have an Intensity rating (1 to 5), with each rank granting a free stunt point exclusively for stunts related to the ship.\nThese bonds can be increased or forged by undertaking &quot;Maintenance&quot; or &quot;Making or Fixing&quot; activities during an interlude, or by crews spending time &quot;Relating&quot; on the ship.\nWhile Ship Bond Intensity can decrease if a character spends a significant amount of time away from the vessel, it can never drop below 1 unless the ship is destroyed.",

You cannot take this action if you are prone (you’d need to use the Move action to stand up first).\n\nDefend\nYou focus on defending yourself. Until the start of your next turn, you gain a +2 bonus to your Defence.\n\nMelee Attack\nYou attack an enemy within 2 meters of you in hand-to-hand combat (see Making Attacks).\n\nRanged Attack\nYou fire or throw a ranged weapon at one visible enemy within range (see Making Attacks).\n\nRun\nYou move up to twice your Speed in meters, sacrificing the ability to perform another action so you can move farther. You cannot take this action if you are prone (you’d need to use the Move minor action to stand up first).\n\nStunt Attack\nInstead of trying to damage an opponent, you focus on performing a specific action stunt, like subduing an enemy with a hold instead of hurting them (a Grapple stunt). Roll an attack test as usual. A successful test awards you 1 SP of a type appropriate for the attack, but the attack itself inflicts no damage. If you roll doubles, you earn additional SP as normal and may choose a stunt that damages your opponent, but there is still no damage from the base attack. You can attempt stunt attacks against objects as well as opponents, though the GM may rule that some stunts do not apply.\n\nMinor Actions\n\nAction\nDetails\n\nActivate\nThis action allows you to start using certain abilities or items, such as certain talents or technology.\n\nAim\nYou take the measure of your opponent and plan your next strike. If your next action after Aim is a melee or ranged attack, you gain a +1 bonus on your attack roll.\n\nGuard Up\nYou balance action and defense. Add +1 or +2 (your choice) to your Defense until the end of the round. However, the same modifier becomes a penalty to all tests you make, even opposed tests, until the end of the round as well (unlike the Defend action, which lasts until the beginning of your next turn). If you choose this minor action, you must do it before any major action on your turn, and you cannot Defend on the same turn.\n\nMove\nYou move up to your Speed in meters and can combine this with actions like dropping prone, standing up, or climbing into a vehicle, but each of these types of actions consumes half your Speed (rounded down).\n\nPrepare\nWhen you take this action, you postpone your major action. You declare one major action and your choice to Prepare it. After you do so, the next person in the initiative order acts, and so on, but at any time until the beginning of your next turn, you can interrupt another character and take your prepared action immediately. If you don’t use the prepared action by your next turn, you lose it.\n\nPress the Attack\nYou stand ready to pursue an enemy if they fall back or flee. You can take this action after successfully striking an enemy target with a melee attack (whether you inflict damage or not). After you declare this action, if that foe moves away from you, you may immediately move up to your Speed in meters in direct pursuit at no additional cost in actions. This occurs immediately after your foe’s movement, before they can do anything else.\n\nReady\nYou draw a weapon, pull out a device, or otherwise ready a stowed item. As part of this action, you can put away something already in hand. You could holster a pistol and pull out a grenade with the same Ready action, for example.\n\nStand Firm\nYou stand firm and prepare to resist any effort to move you. Until the start of your next turn, any enemy using the Skirmish or Knock Prone stunts to move you or knock you to the ground must succeed in an opposed test of their Strength (Might) against your choice of your own Strength (Might) or Dexterity (Acrobatics). If you win the test, the attempt fails. If the attacker wins, the attempt proceeds normally. The attacker still spends the stunt points, regardless of whether the attempt to move you succeeds or fails.\n\nAttack Roll Modifiers\n\nModifier\nCircumstance\n\n-5\nAttacker is blind or otherwise completely unable to see the target.\n\n-3\nDefender in heavy cover, such as a building or stone wall. Melee attacker in heavy snow.\n\n-2\nDefender in light cover, such as a hedge or the woods. Melee attacker in the mud. Ranged attack vs. defender engaged in melee combat. Combat at night.\n\n-1\nRain, mist, or smoke obscures the defender. Combat in low light conditions.\n\n0\nNormal circumstances.\n\n+1\nAttacker is on higher ground. Defender is prone. Melee attacker and allies outnumber defender 2 to 1.\n\n+2\nMelee attacker and allies outnumber defender 3 to 1. Defender is drunk.\n\n+3\nDefender is unaware of the attack.\n\nMorale Tests\nCharacters who fail a Willpower (Morale) test attempt to break off from combat or even surrender.\nConditions triggering a morale test:\n\nWhen more than half of the side’s combatants are taken out of the fight\nWhen the side’s leader or champion is taken out of the fight\nWhen fighting on will clearly mean being trapped or surrounded\nWhen the other side reveals a serious or over whelming advantage\nWhen they fail an opposed TN15 Persuasion test.",

		"content": "General\n\nName\nEffect\n\nBlinded\nA blinded character cannot see and automatically fails ability tests reliant on sight, such as Perception (Seeing).\n\nDeafened\nThe character cannot hear and automatically fails ability tests reliant on hearing, such as Perception (Hearing).\n\nFree Falling\nThe character is effectively weightless in a microgravity or free-fall environment. The character can only move with access to hand-holds, a surface to push off from, or some type of thrust (like from a thruster pack) and, once moving, continues to move with the same speed and trajectory unless acted upon to stop or change their movement.\n\nHindered\nThe character’s Speed is halved (round down) and they cannot take the Charge or Run actions.\n\nProne\nThe character is lying on the ground. The character cannot take the Charge or Run actions, as they can only move by crawling, and standing up from prone requires a Move action using half the character’s Speed. Melee attacks have a +1 bonus against prone characters, while ranged attacks have a –1 penalty.\n\nRestrained\nThe character’s Speed becomes 0 and they effectively cannot move. A restrained condition may prevent a character from taking certain other actions as well, defined by the nature of the restraint.\n\nHealth\n\nName\nEffect\n\nInjured\nThe character is hurt. The character has a –1 penalty to all tests and is fatigued, unable to take the Charge or Run actions. An injured character who receives an additional injured condition becomes wounded.\n\nWounded\nThe character is severely injured. The character has a –2 penalty to all tests and is exhausted, their Speed halved and unable to take the Charge or Run actions. A wounded character who receives an additional injured or wounded condition becomes dying.\n\nDying\nThe character is in danger of perishing. A dying character loses 1 point of Constitution score each round on the start of the character’s turn. When the character’s Constitution score reaches –3, the character dies. Successful first aid applied to a dying character stabilizes their condition, making them helpless, unconscious, and wounded instead. They must recover from these conditions normally (see Interludes in Chapter 5).\n\nHelpless\nThe character is incapable of doing anything. The character cannot take any actions.\n\nUnconscious\nThe character is unaware of their surroundings or the passage of time. The character falls prone and is helpless, unable to take any actions.\n\nStamina\n\nName\nEffect\n\nFatigued\nThe character is tired and cannot take the Charge or Run actions. A fatigued character who receives an additional fatigued condition becomes exhausted.\n\nExhausted\nThe character is severely fatigued. The character’s Speed is halved and they cannot take the Charge or Run actions. An exhausted character who receives an additional fatigued or exhausted condition becomes helpless.\n\nHelpless\nThe character is incapable of doing anything. The character cannot take any actions.",

		"content": "Each quality -&gt; cost +1\nEach flaw -&gt; cost - 1\nGeneral Qualities\n\nQuality\nEffect\n\nDurable\nThe item is built to last. Under normal conditions, it lasts twice as long and for tests involving damaging it, it has +2 Toughness.\n\nEffective\nThe item works better than a regular item of its type, gaining a +1 bonus to one of its abilities. This could be damage, armour bonus, or some other ability used for outcome or effectiveness but not for tests (see Fine, following, for that quality) or a 50% improvement in overall output. A Very Effective item has two qualities and provides a +2 bonus or a 100% improvement.\n\nFast\nThe item works fast. It takes half the usual time to use a regular item of its type. For something used during action time, the character gains a +2 bonus to initiative when using the item\n\nFavoured Stunt\nThe item is either especially well-suited for performing a particular stunt, granting a –1 SP modifier to its cost, or else the item grants access to a unique stunt the character can perform while wielding or using it. Each favoured stunt is a separate quality and an item can have more than one.\n\nFine\nThe item’s quality is such that the character gains a +1 bonus to tests for using or wielding it. Very Fine items have two qualities and provide a +2 bonus.\n\nImpressive\nThe item’s quality is clearly apparent, providing a +1 bonus to social and roleplaying tests where such things are noteworthy, such as trying to make a good impression while wearing an Impressive outfit or intimidating someone with an Impressive weapon. Very Impressive items have two qualities and provide a +2 bonus.\n\nLight\nThe item is lighter and more compact than normal, reducing any penalty to Dexterity and Speed it normally imposes by 1. Very Light items have two qualities and reduce penalties by 2.\n\nGeneral Flaws\n\nFlaw\nEffect\n\nFragile\nThe item wasn’t made to take much punishment. A deliberate attempt to break it always succeeds. Further more, when a test to use the item fails and the Drama Die is 3 or less, the item breaks.\n\nHeavy\nThe item is heavier or bulkier than normal, imposing a –1 penalty to the Dexterity and Speed of a character carrying or wearing it. Very Heavy items have two flaws and impose a –2 penalty to Dexterity and Speed.\n\nIneffective\nThe item can’t inflict damage as easily as a proper weapon, imposing a –1 or –2 penalty to damage rolls, with a minimum damage roll of 1.\n\nPoor\nThe overall poor quality of the item imposes a –1 penalty to tests using or wielding it. Very Poor items have two flaws and impose a –2 penalty.\n\nShoddy\nThe item’s flaws are glaringly apparent, imposing a –1 penalty to social and roleplaying tests where such things are noteworthy, such as trying to intimidate someone with a Shoddy weapon, or make a good first impression in a Shoddy outfit. The GM may adjust the penalty, depending on the circumstances, but it is always negative.\n\nSlow\nThe item works, but not fast. It takes twice as much time to use as a regular item of its type. For something that can be used with a major action during action time, a Slow item requires a Ready action after it is used each time to prepare it to be used again.\n\nUnreliable\nThe item works...most of the time. When a test involving the item fails and the Drama Die is a 3 or less, the item stops working. If the item does not require a test to use, the GM should roll 3d6 when the item needs to work. On a total roll of 10 or less where the Drama Die is a 3 or less, the item stops working. Getting an Unreliable item working again takes either an interlude to fix it or, during action time, a TN 13 challenge test with a success threshold of 10 and a time increment of 1 round.\n\nRanged Weapon Qualities\n\nQuality\nEffect\n\nArmor Piercing\nThe weapon’s rounds reduce the Toughness bonus of worn armour by –2 in terms of reducing their damage. Unfortunately, armour-piercing rounds also have the ability to punch through vacuum sealed bulkheads, so a missed attack with one on a spaceship or station near an outside wall may cause a hull breach. Roll 1d6; on a roll of 1 or 2, a breach occurs and the air begins rushing out of the compartment. See the Threats chapter for details on suffocation hazards\n\nAutomatic\nThe weapon reloads and fires automatically so long as its trigger is depressed. This makes the weapon capable of performing stunts with the (Automatic) quality on the Gun Stunts table in Chapter 5.\n\nHigh Capacity\nThe weapon carries a substantial amount of ammunition. Ignore the first roll indicating the weapon has run out of ammo (see Weapon Capacity, following).\n\nLong Range\nThe weapon’s effective ranges are doubled. See Range under Making Attacks in Chapter 5 for details.\n\nSpreading\nThe weapon fires a spreading cone of pellets, shot, or similar small ammunition, like a shotgun. It does one die less damage, but can hit all targets within a roughly 30-degree angle in front of the shooter.\n\nTracer\nThe weapon fires rounds that glow, leaving visible trails (tracers) behind. A tracer weapon allows the user to take the Aim action as a free action so long as the weapon was fired on the previous round (see Aim under Minor Actions in Chapter 5).\n\nTranquilizer\nA tranquilizer or tranq weapon fires a hypodermic dart preloaded with a dose of a drug, usually a powerful tranquilizer to knock out its target. The dart won’t penetrate any armour, but if it hits an unarmoured target, the character must make a TN 13 Constitution (Tolerance) test or become unconscious. A successful test means the character is only fatigued.\n\nMakeshift Weapon Flaws\n\nFlaw\nEffect\n\nClumsy\nThe weapon is awkward to wield, imposing a –1 or –2 penalty to attack tests.\n\nFragile\nThe weapon wasn’t made to take much punishment. When an attack with it misses and the Drama Die is 3 or less, the object breaks and becomes useless as a weapon\n\nWeak\nThe object can’t inflict damage as easily as a proper weapon, imposing a –1 or –2 penalty to damage rolls, with a minimum damage roll of 1.",
