The GM decides how an NPC feels about you based on that character’s motives and emotions.\nNPCs will never defy their most deeply held values or sacrifice their personal safety without an exceptional circumstance coming into play.\nDetermining Attitude\nRoll 3D6 plus following modifiers\n\nModifier\nDetails\n\nCommunication\nAdd the Communication ability score of the character taking the lead in making contact. If a Communication focus would apply to the first impression, add its bonus as well.\n\nReputation\nAdd +2 for a Reputation that would impress the NPC. Impose -2 for a Reputation that would offend the NPC.\n\nOther modifiers\nThe GM can add other modifiers to the roll based on the NPC’s known feelings and motives.\n\nThe take attitude from table below\n\nRoll\nAttitude\nModifier\nDescription\n\n&lt; 3\nVery Hostile\n-3\nThe very hostile NPC can barely contain their dislike, and is inclined to respond to contact with either violence or by leaving the characters’ presence. They may nurse a grudge and oppose the characters in the future. This is a rare spontaneous impression, and the GM should come up with a specific reason why any first impression would get a Very Hostile response.\n\n4-5\nHostile\n-2\nThe hostile NPC reacts to contact with ire, but might disguise this. They either refuse to provide help, or undermine the characters’ apparent interests.\n\n6-8\nStandoffish\n-1\nThe standoffish NPC would prefer that the characters just leave them alone. They either avoid the characters, ignore them, or firmly ask interlopers to go away.\n\n9-11\nNeutral\n+0\nThe neutral NPC hasn’t decided things either way about characters making contact, and responds with cool caution, bored disinterest, or polite detachment, depending on their personality.\n\n12-14\nOpen\n+1\nThe open NPC is curious or inclined to listen to the characters, and reacts appropriately based on their own motives and interests. Things could go either way. A negative variation of Open is Cowed, where the NPC is a bit afraid of what the characters might do if they don’t act receptive. Once the threat appears to be gone, the NPC becomes Standoffish.\n\n15-17\nFriendly\n+2\nThe friendly NPC takes a shine to characters making contact and is inclined to help them, but hesitates to provide any assistance that could cause them problems. A negative variation of Friendly is Shaken, where the NPC provides assistance out of fear. Once the threat appears to be gone, the NPC becomes Hostile.\n\n18+\nVery Friendly\n+3\nThe very friendly NPC is exceptionally welcoming, and provides gestures of respect or hospitality without being prompted. The NPC may provide extraordinary help, though nothing that contradicts their values. This is a rare spontaneous impression, and the GM should come up with a specific reason why any first impression would get a Very Friendly response. A negative variation of Very Friendly is Terrified, where the NPC anxiously does anything possible to avoid a perceived (or very real) threat. Once the threat is gone and the NPC feels safe, their attitude shifts to Very Hostile.\n\nInteractions\nSimple Social Interactions\nCommunication test vs NPC Willpower\nDetailed Social Interactions\nGoal is to change an NPC’s attitude to one where they feel inclined to do something in your favour.\nSocial Combat\nDetermine shifts required:\n\nDecide NPC’s current attitude, and the attitude required to comply with your wishes.\nNote number of shifts to move along character\nAdd 1 shift to focus the NPC’s attention toward doing what you wish\nCan add 1 or 2 shifts to represent the NPC’s greater resistance to your efforts if the desired actions would inconvenience or trouble them in some way\n\nShifts can be achieved through:\n\nSocial manoeuvres:\n\nEach shift becomes an action\nCan be opposed tests or tasks to complete\nClear additional shifts first\nUtterly failing -&gt; may set back progress by one or more shifts\n\nGrand gesture:\n\nperform a single ambitious gesture intended to influence the NPC in one fell swoop\nadvanced test -&gt; 3-5 x number of shifts\nachieving threshold -&gt; success, falling short -&gt; nothing",

A space combat round typically lasts around a minute.\n\n[!todo] Steps\n\nDecide on a course of action\nGive commands\nRoll a Command test\nDistribute SP if desired\n\nAction\nDetails\n\nCommand Test\nTN11 Communication (Leadership Test)\n\nSuccess\n1SP + Drama Die SP with doubles\n\nStunt Points\nCan be used or passed to crew who can bank or use the SP\n\nPlanning\nPlanning A commander may spend their turn banking SP toward a specific stunt or combo of stunts. To do so, they declare the intended stunt(s) and make a TN 13 Intelligence (Tactics) test. On success, they store 2 SP—or the drama die result if doubles are rolled—for future use.Banked SP cannot be used in the same round and must be spent in a later round. A commander may repeat the test in later rounds to accumulate enough SP for the declared stunt(s).Planning must target a specific stunt cost and cannot be used to simply enhance stunts like Guidance or Evasive Action.\n\nShip Command Stunts\n\nSP\nStunt\nDetails\n\n1+\nGuidance\n+1 bonus to chosen ship combat test this round.Choose from:- manoeuvre test- electronic warfare test- evasion test- point defence test- damage control test\n\n1+\nBlinding Manoeuvre\nReduces an opposing ship’s Sensors score by 1 (to a minimum score of –2) until the start of the next round.\n\n2\nMulti-targeting\nPBCs can both attack and defend this round without any penalty.\n\n2\nDown With the Ship\nIn an act of heroism, the commander can expend their own Fortune to remove damage taken by other characters (as the result of a Collateral Loss) on board the ship.\n\n2\nFollow the Leader\nAt close range, you tail another ship, mirroring its movements.- +2 to evasion against all ships except the one you're following- You gain any cover the lead ship enters- Remain in position unless the lead ship wins an opposed Dexterity (Piloting) test\n\n2+\nOn-target\nIncreases the TN of tests to evade your ship’s weapon attacks that round by +1.\n\n2+\nTactics\nIncreases the TN of an opposing ship commander’s next command test by +1.\n\n3\nPerceived weakness\nYou increase the damage of one successful weapon attack by 1d6.\n\n3+\nEvasive Action\nGrants a +1d6 Hull bonus to your ship that round for resisting damage from successful weapon attacks.\n\n3\nExploitable Terrain\nIf near exploitable terrain (e.g. asteroids, dust cloud), you identify a path offering cover. Immediately trigger either the Evasive Manoeuvre or Follow the Leader stunt.\n\n3+\nCalculation\nYou can bank the SP you just spent for this stunt +1 and use them on a later stunt. You can also combine these SP with future SP earned.\n\n4\nPrecise hit\nOne successful weapon attacks results in an additional Loss, even if the target’s Hull completely eliminated the damage\n\n4\nSkimming\nA ship near a planet with an atmosphere can attempt to evade pursuit by diving into it. The pilot makes an opposed TN 17 Dexterity (Piloting) test. On success, the pursuing ship loses track of the target.On subsequent rounds, the pursuer may attempt opposed TN 11 Intelligence (Technology) + Sensors tests to reacquire the target.\n\n4\nToo Close\nThis stunt can be used when engaged with multiple enemies and adjacent to a ship (or station) at least one size class larger.The pilot attempts to position the ship so that attacking it risks hitting the larger vessel. During the Manoeuvre phase, make an opposed TN 15 Dexterity (Piloting) test against the larger ship, with a –2 penalty. Reduce the TN by 1 for each additional size class difference.- Success: +2 to evasion against all ships except the one used for cover.- Drama Die 5–6 on a missed attack: The larger ship is hit instead.- Both pilots fail: The ships collide—2d6 damage to the larger ship, 4d6 to the smaller.\n\n4+\nSet-up\nYou force an enemy ship into a nearby hazard (e.g. debris, short-range weapon, asteroid).This counts as a weapon attack dealing damage equal to half the SP spent (rounded down).The target may evade with a TN equal to: 10 + your Intelligence + Leadership (if any) + ½ SP spent.\n\n5\nBurn Them\nAt extremely close range (under 1 km), you can use your Epstein drive as a weapon by flipping and burning toward an enemy ship.Make an opposed TN 19 Dexterity (Piloting) test at –2.- Success: The enemy is caught in your drive plume, taking 6d6 damage. - Failure: No damage is dealt, but penalties still apply. During the manoeuvre:- Only rear-facing weapons can fire. - Enemies gain +2 to evasion against your attacks.- Your ship suffers –2 to all evasion tests.\n\n5\nWeapon Online\nA crew member can temporarily restore a damaged or depleted weapon.Make a TN 14 Intelligence (Engineering) or Dexterity (Gunnery) test. Success: The weapon functions for 1d3 shots, then fails permanently until full maintenance is performed at a spaceport.\n\n6\nQuick Start\nThe crew can attempt to make a quick repair and restart the ship’s reactor.This requires two characters to work together; one must make a TN 14 Intelligence (Technology) test and another must make a TN 14 Intelligence (Engineering) test, and they must reach a threshold of 15.\n\n7\nMisdirect\nYou attempt to redirect an incoming torpedo toward a nearby ship by performing a close-range flip and burn.Requires:- An opposed Dexterity (Piloting) test against the nearby ship- A TN 17 Intelligence (Technology) test by another crew memberSuccess on both: The torpedo strikes the other ship instead.\n\nFleet Command Stunts\n\nSP\nStunt\nDetails\n\n1+\nCombined Fire\nYou coordinate fire with an allied ship, increasing the likelihood that both of you hit the target. Every 1 SP you spend increases the TN of tests made to evade your ship’s attack by +1. Both captains must spend this SP\n\n2+\nDraw Fire\nYou manage to draw fire from an enemy’s intended target. For every 2 SP spent, an attacker that was going to attack an ally attacks your ship instead\n\n2+\nGood Advice\nThis stunt allows one commander to aid another, either by giving them a bonus to their next command test or giving them SP. Every 2 SP you spend gives an allied Commander +1 on their next test or 1 SP to spend\n\nPilot Actions\nStep 2: Manoeuvres\n\n[!todo] Steps\n\nSelect manoeuvring actions\nMake required rolls\nSpend SP if applicable\n\nActions\nDetails\n\nChange Range\nAutomatically change by one range band\n\nPrevent change\n- Opposed Dexterity (Piloting) test between the two ships to prevent change in range- Smaller ship getting a +1 bonus per Size category smaller than the larger ship\n\nHigh-G Manoeuvring\n- Adds a bonus from +1 to +6 to the manoeuvre test result- Allows the ship to shift up to two range bands.\n\nHigh-G effects\nRequires all characters on board to perform a Constitution (Stamina) test vs TN of 8 + manoeuvre bonus:\n\nfailure -&gt; the character suffers 1d6 penetrating damage per point of manoeuvre bonus\nsuccess -&gt; half 1d6 penetrating damage per point of manoeuvre bonus\n\nThe Juice\n\nCharacters with access to the juice can take fatigued and exhausted conditions first to mitigate the damage before they take injured or wounded conditions, otherwise they have to take just injured and wounded conditions.\nGood juice ship quality provides +2 to Constitution (Stamina) test\nBad juice ship flaw detracts -2 from Constitution (Stamina) test\n\nManoeuvres Stunts\n\nSP\nStunt\nDetails\n\n1+\nBlinding Manoeuvre\nReduces an opposing ship’s Sensors score by 1 (to a minimum score of –2) until the start of the next round.\n\n2\nEvasive Manoeuver\nUntil your next turn, attacks against you and your ship (if any) suffer a -2 penalty\n\n2\nFollow the Leader\nAt close range, you tail another ship, mirroring its movements.- +2 to evasion against all ships except the one you're following- You gain any cover the lead ship enters- Remain in position unless the lead ship wins an opposed Dexterity (Piloting) test\n\n2+\nSteady as She Goes\nPilot can lessen the potential high-g manoeuvres damage to passengers. For every 2 SP spent the TN for the Constitution (Stamina) test is reduced by 1.\n\n4\nBlockade\nYou manoeuvre to block an enemy’s line to its target (other than your ship).The enemy suffers –2 to manoeuvre tests to pursue or attack that target, or the target gains +2 to evasion (pilot’s choice).\n\n4+\nSet-up\nYou force an enemy ship into a nearby hazard (e.g. debris, short-range weapon, asteroid).This counts as a weapon attack dealing damage equal to half the SP spent (rounded down).The target may evade with a TN equal to: 10 + your Intelligence + Leadership (if any) + ½ SP spent.\n\n5\nDauntless\nAt close range, you fake a ramming manoeuvre to disrupt an enemy ship.The enemy must make a TN 15 Dexterity (Piloting) test.- Failure: They flinch and take no further actions this round.- Success: If they don’t flinch, your pilot must pass a TN 17 Dexterity (Piloting) test to avoid an actual collision (regardless, your ship can still act).\n\nStep 5A: Defensive Pilot Actions\n\n[!todo] Steps\n\nDecide on High-G Manoeuvres\nPerform an evasive manoeuvres for every weapon system fired at you.\nTorpedoes need to be evaded individually\nSpend SP if applicable\n\nAction\nDetails\n\nEvade Torpedo\nComplete a Evade test for each torpedo- Launched from Long Range -&gt; cannot evade, only shoot down- Launched from Medium Range -&gt; 3d6 + Dex (Piloting) vs. TN 12 + attacking ship sensors + attack bonus- Launched from Short Range -&gt; 3d6 + Dex (Piloting) vs. TN 10 + attacking ship sensors + attack bonus\n\nEvade Railgun\n- Long Range -&gt; automatic success- Medium Range -&gt; 3d6 + Dex (Piloting) vs. TN 10 + attacking ship sensors + attack bonus- Short Rang-&gt; 3d6 + Dex (Piloting) vs. TN 12 + attacking ship sensors + attack bonus\n\nEvade PDC\n- Long Range -&gt; automatic success- Medium Range -&gt; automatic success- Short Range -&gt; 3d6 + Dex (Piloting) + bonus vs. TN 10 + attacking ship sensors + attack bonus- If opponent used PDC for defence and attack -&gt; TN 8\n\nHigh-G Manoeuvring\n- Adds a bonus from +1 to +6 to the evasion test result\n\nHigh-G effects\nRequires all characters on board to perform a Constitution (Stamina) test vs TN of 8 + manoeuvre bonus:\n\nfailure -&gt; the character suffers 1d6 penetrating damage per point of manoeuvre bonus\nsuccess -&gt; half 1d6 penetrating damage per point of manoeuvre bonus\n\nThe Juice\n\nCharacters with access to the juice can take fatigued and exhausted conditions first to mitigate the damage before they take injured or wounded conditions, otherwise they have to take just injured and wounded conditions.\nGood juice ship quality provides +2 to Constitution (Stamina) test\nBad juice ship flaw detracts -2 from Constitution (Stamina) test\n\nDefensive Pilot Stunts\n\nSP\nStunt\nDetails\n\n3+\nEvasive Action\nGrants a +1d6 Hull bonus to your ship that round for resisting damage from successful weapon attacks.\n\n7\nMisdirect\nYou attempt to redirect an incoming torpedo toward a nearby ship by performing a close-range flip and burn.Requires:- An opposed Dexterity (Piloting) test against the nearby ship- A TN 17 Intelligence (Technology) test by another crew memberSuccess on both: The torpedo strikes the other ship instead.\n\nComms Officer Actions\nStep 3: Electronic Warfare\n\n[!todo] Steps\n\nPerform Electronic Warfare test\nMake required rolls\nChoose how to distribute bonus\nSpend SP if applicable\n\nActions\nDetails\n\nEW Test\nOpposed Intelligence (Technology) test + Ship sensors vs TN 11Winner gains half drama die (rounded up) bonus to apply to either:- add to all defensive actions- increase the Target Number (TN) to evade the winning ship's attacks\n\nElectronic Warfare Stunts\n\nSP\nStunt\nDetails\n\n1+\nEat Static\nYou adjust your ship’s active emissions in a way that makes it harder to target, adding +SP to your ship’s next electronic warfare test.\n\n2+\nTurnabout is Fair Play\nIf a torpedo is under manual control, your sensor operator may attempt to seize control. Make an opposed Intelligence (Technology) + Sensors test against the enemy ship.

If the crew does not meet the min, add a -2 modifier for each category drop.\nCrew Competence\nFor ships crew by NPCs, ability test bonuses are determined by the crew competence.\n\nCompetence\nBonus\n\nIncompetent\n0\n\nPoor\n1\n\nAverage\n2\n\nCapable\n3\n\nSkilled\n4\n\nElite\n5\n\nDrive\nEven at a high-g burn, regular breaks must be taken for the crew to attend to their biological needs and recover, which means that ships must have stores of food, water, air, medicine, and other consumables in proportion to the crew and the distance the ship plans to travel.\nAn Epstein Drive plume is visible and detectable over a considerable distance, meaning a ship on the burn is fairly easy to track.\nThe plume itself is capable of reducing any matter in it down to its constituent atoms, and firing a drive in close proximity to a station, an asteroid, or another ship can cause considerable damage.\nSensors\nA ship’s Sensors score measures the overall effectiveness of this equipment, on a range from –2 to 6 or more.\nWeapons\nWhile civilian ships are unarmed, military and security craft have a variety of weapons, as do some pirates and similar illegal ships.\nTypes of weapons:\n\nGrapplers\nPoint defence cannons (PBCs)\nRail Guns\nTorpedoes\n\nCountermeasures\nMost ships also have defensive countermeasures packages used to help keep enemies from targeting them:\n\nCommunications arrays can broadcast cycling bursts of radio static across commonly used frequencies to jam communications, and at close enough range\nCommunications lasers can be used to try and blind enemy targeting optics\nPhysical chaff can be ejected into space between the ship and enemies, spreading out clutter to interfere with targeting lasers or radar.\n\nQualities and flaws\nQualities\n\nQuality\nEffect\n\nAcceleration, Improved\nThe ship can accelerate faster. When performing a high-g maneuver, the ship can add a bonus of up to +7. The ship also gets a +1 to the Piloting test when attempting to increase or decrease range. Additional applications of this bonus can be taken, which increases the high-g maneuver bonus by 1 for each, up to a maximum of +9. Each additional level also grants another +1 to the Piloting test to increase range, up to a maximum of +3.\n\nAdvanced Sensor Package\n+1 increase in Sensors score for each time this quality is applied.Sensors score usually maxes out at 6, unless the GM chooses to make an exception.\n\nAgile\nOnly ships of Small or Medium size can take this quality. The ship is extremely nimble and able to maneuver easier than other ships. The ship gets a +1 to Evasion tests and any other Piloting tests that require maneuverability. Additional applications can be taking which grant an additional +1 up to a maximum of +3. A ship must be designed and built to have this capability. It cannot be added later.\n\nAltered Transponder Code\nThe ship has access to or use of an altered transponder code, allowing it to appear as another ship with a different name and point of origin. This can provide a way around any number of prob lems that might arise in the course of a vessel’s life. It should be noted that changing a transponder code is highly illegal. MCRN ships are designed as such so that if the transponder code is altered without the proper access codes the ship self-destructs.\n\nAtmosphere Capable\nThe ship can operate in a planetary atmosphere for limited periods of time and is capable of landing. Generally, a ship must be designed and built to have this capability. It cannot be added later.\n\nCommunication Systems, Advanced\nThe ship’s communications systems, both tightbeam and radio array, have an increased bandwidth that results in shorter relay times, although lightspeed still dictates the minimum transmis sion time of interplanetary communications. The advanced communications system can also send and receive encrypted messages and provide a private network for all inbound and outbound comm traffic. It can even break through some jamming frequencies. Flagships often have advanced communications systems so that they can better organize attacks. The SP cost for any Fleet Command Stunts is reduced by 1.\n\nDisguise\nThe ship has been disguised in some way to conceal its true provenance or purpose. While not as effec tive as stealth, Disguise combined with an Altered Transponder Code, may allow a ship to pass inspection if those looking don’t know what they’re looking for. This can counter the Wanted flaw (see the Spaceships chapter of The Expanse RPG) or similar difficulties but is not meant as a permanent solution to either.\n\nDrone Bay\nThe ship has at least two drones for combat, visual reconnaissance, or repair. These can be remote controlled by crewmembers who can pilot them or by a computer system.\n\nEmergency Batteries\nAll ships have batteries that allow them to run life support and maneuvering thrusters (although not the Epstein drive) even when the engines are offline for a limited period—usually less than a week depending how much power is used. Emergency batteries allow a ship to operate for months without reactor power.\n\nFlagship\nFlagships are the leaders to fleets and are often on the front line and the hub of command and communi cations in battle. During the Command step of space combat, the flagship generates an additional 2 SP and can give any of their generated SP to allied ships. This SP is added to any SP generated by that ship during its Command step.\n\nGood Juice\n+2 bonus on Constitution (Stamina) tests against high-acceleration manoeuvres.\n\nGourmet Galley\nThe ship has an extensive galley capable of turning out extravagant meals that are well-balanced and nutritious, and nutritious. It also has a high-quality coffee (and beverage) maker that makes a cup of coffee as good as any found on Earth. The crew has a +1 bonus to a Constitution or Willpower test once per session when they have regular access. Maintaining this quality requires adding +1 to the Resupply Cost to maintain the ship (see Resupply in Chapter 1 of this book). The crew can eliminate this cost by losing this quality.\n\nHanger Bay\nCarrying ships totalling up to three or more Size categories smaller than it. Contains all of the necessary equipment for maintenance.\n\nHidden Compartments\nDesigned for smuggling or otherwise concealing cargo from inspections or borders.\n\nHull Platting\n+1 bonus when determining its Hull total against damage. Have multiple times, up to a maximum equal to its Hull score in dice.\n\nImproved Stores\nCapable of stocking supplies for extended travel for its crew and a number of passengers equal to half its optimal crew listing.\n\nLuxury Amenities\nEspecially fine or luxurious accommodations.Adds +1 to the Lifestyle Cost to maintain the shipContributes to reputations\n\nManoeuvrable\nConsidered one Size category smaller than its actual Size for tests to change range, to evade attacks, and for chases. Highly Manoeuvrable -&gt; effectively two Size categories smaller.\n\nMedical Expert System\nauto doc provides treatment character with the Intelligence (Medicine) focus with a +2 bonus. Additional applications -&gt; +1 bonus per option to a maximum of +5.\n\nNetwork and Database Access, Improved\nIn addition to the public access databases and local networks, the ship has improved and private access to more advanced stores and databanks of information. Using this terminal can give a +1 bonus to any advanced Intelligence (Current Affairs or Research) test made on board.\n\nPlasma Torpedoes\nThe ship must have a Torpedo Launcher. The ship is equipped with plasma torpedoes, designed to burn through hulls and inflict focused damage. The torpedo does 4d6 damage, and when a 1 or 2 is rolled for damage, it is counted as a 3.\n\nRail Gun, High-Charge\nThe ship must be at least Large Size. These rail guns fire with a higher thrust than stan dard issue rail guns, and the slugs are supercharged to do extra damage when they impact with hulls. The rail gun does 3d6 damage, but when a 1 or 2 is rolled for damage, it is counted as a 3.\n\nRapid Reload Torpedo Tubes\nThe ship can reload torpedoes at a faster than normal rate. SP cost to use the Rapid Reload Command Stunt is reduced by 1.\n\nReduced Crew Requirements\nThe ship has optimized controls to allow it to be manned by a smaller crew. Halve the crew requirement for the ship (with a minimum of 1)\n\nReliable\nThe ship is particularly dependable: it works the way it’s supposed to when its crew needs it to, and its upkeep is minimal. Though the crew still must dedicate activities to Maintenance during Interludes, the GM should reduce the Resupply Cost of maintaining the ship by 2.\n\nRedundant Hull (Double)\nA double hull provides a redundant barrier against the vacuum—usually by a few to several feet—in case the outer hull is damaged. This is standard on most Martian military ships. The ship can ignore the f irst loss condition imposed in an encounter. See Losses in the Spaceships chapter of The Expanse RPG.\n\nRedundant Hull (Triple)\nFor maximum redundancy, the ship has a triple hull design. Less common than the Double Hull, this is primarily a feature of the yachts of the obscenely wealthy. The ship can ignore the first two loss conditions imposed in an encounter. See Losses under Space Combat in the Spaceships chapter of The Expanse RPG.\n\nRepair Facilities\nThe ship has built-in facilities that can repair damage taken to other ships. Most standard losses can be repaired by a ship with repair facilities. To be able to repair serious losses, the ship must also have the Hanger Bay Quality and the ship to be repaired must be able to fit into the hanger bay.\n\nSecurity Systems, Advanced\nThe ship’s security systems and associated software are technologically advanced, providing a +1 bonus to crew Security or Technology tests involving the ship. Additional applications of this quality provide the crew with an additional +1 bonus per option, to a maximum of +5.\n\nSelf-destruct system\nProgrammed to drop the containment on the ship’s fusion reactor. Countdown or a dead-man’s switch\n\nSensor Scrambling\nWhen an enemy is within Medium or closer range, they suffer -1 to all Sensors tests.\n\nStealth\nWhile the ship is at rest, with its drive inactive and using only passive sensors, it is effectively invisible and undetectable to ship sensors.\n\nStealth, Improved\nProtogen stealth technology is more advanced than anything currently used by the UNN and the MCRN. Not only is this ship completely invisible to sensors when its engines are shut off, but heat sinks and other advanced technology make this ship harder to target, giving all enemy ships a -2 to all Electronic Warfare tests.\n\nSturdy\nThe ship is well built and can take more damage than expected for a ship of its size. The Hull receives a +2 to its value: for example, a Sturdy Large frigate would have a Hull score of 2d6+2 rather than the usual 2d6. A ship must be designed and built to have this capability. It cannot be added later.\n\nTargeting Systems, Advanced\nThe ship has a +1 bonus to the Sensors score for Electronic Warfare tests.\n\nUltraluxury Amenities\nThe ship is an ultraluxury vessel with accommodations that would not be out of place in any seven-star resort—full decks given over to sumptuously decorated quarters with staffed galleys, private baths, and lounges—all the best money can buy. And it does cost money: this quality adds +4 to the Resupply Cost to maintain the ship (see the Resupply Cost table in Chapter 1 of this book). The crew can eliminate the increase to Cost by losing this quality, but the ship will not function as it is meant to; it would be somewhat like trying to run a fancy hotel without a staff.\n\nWeapons - PBCs\nOne quality -&gt; cover to forward arcTwo qualities -&gt; full coverage\n\nWeapons - Rail Gun\nMust be at least Medium-sizedSpinal-mounted -&gt; forward or rear firing positionLarge or larger ships -&gt; two rail guns (one in each direction)Gigantic or larger ship -&gt; rail guns on turrets half-spherical range of fire on one side of the ship.\n\nWeapons - Torpedo Launcher\nMedium-sized -&gt; 1 torpedo launcherAdditional Size category -&gt; adds capacity for one launcher\n\nFlaws\n\nFlaw\nEffect\n\nAging\nThe ship is still in good shape but getting older, so it requires extra work to keep flying at its best. The GM should require additional Maintenance, Researching, and/or Fixing activities during Interludes (see Interludes in Chapter 5: Game Play of The Expanse RPG) and increase the Resupply Cost of by +1 to represent the additional mate rials needed for minor upkeep and repairs.\n\nBad Juice\n–1 penalty to Constitution tests involving acceleration hazards.\n\nBanned from Port\nThe ship has been banned from a major port for some reason—warranted or unwarranted. It could be due to substandard maintenance, disturbing the peace, or worse. This flaw should be paired with a specific port in Sol System and can be picked up during gameplay at GM’s discretion.\n\nFaulty System\nThe first use of the system in an encounter roll a die: - 1 or 2 -&gt; system stops working, just like a loss due to damage.\n\nFragile\nReduce its Hull score to that of the Size category one below the ship’s Size.\n\nHigh Maintenance\nRequire additional Maintenance activities and increase the Lifestyle Cost of maintaining the ship by +1.\n\nLimited Range\nThe ships does not carry enough reaction mass for long distance travel using its Epstein drive. Such ships usually have a range of about 1 AU (the distance of earth to the Sun or, roughly, earth to Mars and back).\n\nLumbering\nConsidered one Size category larger for manoeuvring tests.\n\nOld\nThe ship is old—between fifty years and a century’s service in space—and nothing works like it did when it was brand new. The GM should require additional Maintenance, Researching, and Fixing activities during Interludes (see Interludes in Chapter 5: Game Play of The Expanse RPG) and increase the Resupply Cost of by +2 to represent the additional materials needed for minor upkeep and repairs\n\nPoor Acceleration\nThe ship does not accelerate as fast as others of its Size. When performing a high-g manoeuvre, the ship can only add a bonus up to +5 (rather than the usual +6). The ship also suffers a -1 to the Piloting test when attempting to increase or decrease range. This Flaw can be taken up to six times, making the high-g manoeuvre bonus 0 and applying a -6 penalty to Piloting tests when attempting to increase or decrease range.\n\nPoor Amenities\nRecovering activities on board take 50% longer.\n\nSoftware Glitch\nThe ship has a glitch in the software that has been missed by updates and system scans, making it vulnerable to hacking. It is at a -1 penalty in all opposed Electronic Warfare tests (see Space Combat in the Spaceships chapter of The Expanse RPG for details)\n\nThrusters Only\nThe ship is only intended for short trips between planet and moon or station to station and not equipped with an Epstein drive. It limits the ship’s speed to up to 1 g until otherwise modified and takes a considerable amount of time to get up to this speed.\n\nUncomfortable\nCrewmembers find the ship’s space, furniture, and facilities inconvenient to use due to size constraints. Either these are too small, in the case of a pre-Belter era design, or too large, in the case of being designed specifically for Belters only, for some members of the crew. For applicable crewmembers, this will create a -1 penalty to all ship-related actions\n\nVulnerable Systems\nWhen the ship takes losses, choose an additional loss condition\n\nVulnerability\nThe ship has a weakness in the exterior (hull, hangar, cargo bay, etc.) that could be breached for boarding or worse. Anyone scanning the ship can make a TN 13 Intelligence (Technology) test to detect the weakness. Targeted weapon attacks that aim for the weakness impose a impose a -1 penalty to absorbing the Hull damage from that attack.\n\nWanted\nCan cause problems docking at legitimate ports, or might mean the ship needs to avoid certain places or routes in order to avoid further trouble.\n\nWeak Hull\nThe ship has a -1 penalty when determining the Hull total against damage. A ship can have this flaw multiple times, up a maximum equal to its Hull score in dice. For example, if the Hull is 3d6 the flaw can be taken three times.\n\nMaintenance and Upkeep\nGM should take the crew’s need to maintain their ship into account for maintenance activities during interludes, and remind players that neglecting these responsibilities may lead to the ship developing flaws or even suffering some losses, as if it were damaged.",

If you fail an Intelligence (Research) test, you can re-roll it, but must keep the result of the second roll.\nre-roll failed research test\n\nExpert\nYou have become adept at recalling relevant information. When you perform the A-Ha! stunt, you gain one free extra use of it; that is, if you spend 1 SP, you can perform the stunt twice, if you spend 2 SP, you can use it three times, and so on.\n\nMaster\nYour fact-finding abilities are unparalleled. When you make an Intelligence (Research) test as part of an advanced test, you gain a +1 bonus to the result of each Drama Die. This increases your total roll, and allows you to reach the success threshold faster.\n\nAce\nFew can fly like you do.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nDexterity 3 or higher and the Dexterity (Piloting) focus.\n\nNovice\nYou can coax more out of your ship than most. When you perform the Punch It chase stunt, you gain an extra +1 bonus on your next chase test, above the bonus gained for the stunt (so the bonus is +2 when you spend 1 SP, +3 when you spend 2 SP and so on).\n\nExpert\nAdd +2 to the Drama Die when making tests using the Dexterity (Piloting) focus.\n\nMaster\nYou are a peerless pilot. Add +1 to tests made using Dexterity (Piloting) and you may re-roll a failed test, although you don’t get the bonus on the re-roll and must take the result of the second roll.\n\nAgent\nYou’re a skilled spy and infiltrator.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nPerception 2 or higher and the Perception (Empathy) and Communication (Deception) focuses.\n\nNovice\nYou built your life on lies. If you fail a Communication (Deception) test, you can re-roll it, but must keep the result of the second roll.\nre-roll deception tests\n\nExpert\nYou are also adept at seeing through deception. When you use the Read the Room stunt, add +3 to your Perception (Empathy) roll when the stunt is opposed.\n+3 to Empathy for read the room <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/diomedes-spear/rules/stunts/#social-stunts\">Stunts#Social Stunts</a>\n\nMaster\nYou are a masterful spy. You gain two of the following focuses if you don’t have them already: Communication (Disguise), Communication (Investigation), Dexterity (Stealth), Intelligence (Cryptography), and Intelligence (Security). If you already have all of these, pick two and add +1 to all rolls made using them.\ngain or +1 to disguise, investigation, stealth, cryptography, security\n\nBounty Hunter\nYou know how to find the right jobs, how to track down your target and get the job done with a minimum of fuss, and how to ensure you get paid before moving on to the next bounty.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nPerception 2 or higher and at least one Perception focus.\n\nNovice\nYou can designate someone or something as your “quarry” after spending at least an hour on the job investigating them, including reading a prepared brief or dossier. You can only have one active quarry at a time but can substitute a new quarry for a previous one with an additional time investment. Usually, your quarry is the focus of the bounty you’re currently pursuing. You’re considered to always have the tangential focus necessary to investigate your quarry, and if you have the primary or tangential focus, you gain a +1 bonus on your tests to investigate them. You also gain the benefits of the Dexterity (Initiative) and Perception (Intuition) focuses\n\nExpert\nYou can prepare a major action in relation to your quarry. Whenever you roll initiative against your quarry, you can perform your prepared action first before your quarry acts regardless of the initiative order; you then take your normal actions on your turn. Prepared actions may include things like a Run or Charge towards your quarry, an Attack against them, and attempt to hide from them, or a Stunt Attack directed at them. You can choose your prepared action up to when initiative is rolled. Once action time begins, however, it can’t be changed; you can either take the prepared action or choose not to—if circumstances allow.\n\nMaster\nWhen you surprise your quarry, you are automatically considered to have them dead-to-rights. You have a +2 bonus for any tests to see if you surprise your quarry. This is in addition to any bonuses from ability focuses or your Novice ability for this specialization. Also, if you fail an ability test to unlock a clue related to your quarry, you can re-roll the test and use the result of the second roll instead\n\nCommando\nYou are trained to fight, and to win, no matter the odds.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nConstitution 2 or higher and the Willpower (Self-Discipline) focus.\n\nNovice\nIf you fail a Constitution or Willpower (Self Discipline) test, you can re-roll, but must keep the result of the second roll.\n\nExpert\nYou know how to work with a team to get things done. At this degree, you gain an intensity 1 Relationship with your team, whoever that may be, and you keep the relationship even if the membership of your team changes. You can increase the intensity of this Relationship normally. See the Rewards chapter for details on Relationships.\n\nMaster\nYou can overcome the effects of some conditions through sheer grit. When you acquire the exhausted, fatigued, injured, or wounded conditions, make a TN 13 Constitution (Stamina) or Willpower (Self Discipline) test; if you succeed, you ignore the effects of the condition for the remainder of the encounter, although the condition itself remains.\n\nEntertainer\nIn a solar system containing billions of people, it’s possible for your voice to rise above the crowd—but what will you have to say if it does?\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nFocus in your area of influence with Attribute of 2 or higher\n\nNovice\nYou’ve got some raw potential, and you’re starting to learn how to experiment with it. Sometimes that blows up in your face, but sometimes it finds brilliance in what was otherwise an average work of art. Whenever you roll a test to create or perform art, you may choose to re-roll the attempt but must keep the new roll even if it’s worse. In addition, you should explain how a success transforms a performance that wasn’t going well or how a failure results in a promising piece going off the rails.\n\nExpert\nYou have developed a signature style, possibly even a signature piece such as a custom instrument or beloved persona, and it’s something with which audiences strongly connect. Talk to the GM to develop a clear idea of what this entails, but it should be fairly narrow— “making music” is not a valid signature since it could apply to almost any test for a musician, but “playing daggri-punk” or “my drag persona Miss Fifi Fofum” would both be acceptable since they are specific as to when they apply. Whenever you create using your signature, you can choose to either gain a +2 on the subsequent Income test or reduce the cost of Stunts while using it by 1 SP (minimum 1).\n\nMaster\nYour art is a part of you, and even those who aren’t familiar with your medium can tell right away that you have a gift for it. You make the most challenging artistic feats look easy and attempt things other artists can’t even dream of doing. Reduce the Test Difficulty by one category for all tests related to artistic creation and performance or by two categories if you can feature your signature. In addition, if the Drama Die is lower than 3 on a performance roll related to your art, treat it as though you rolled a 3 in terms of degrees of success. This can be further modified with the Right in the Feels Stunt.\n\nExecutive\nYou claim authority and leadership in an organization.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nCommunication 2 or higher and the Communication (Persuasion) focus.\n\nNovice\nYou have experience in negotiating the byways of your organization. You acquire a Membership in a new organization or advance to the next rank with an existing Membership (see the Rewards chapter for details on Memberships). You can re-roll any test to access privileges from, or influence members of, the organization behind this acquired or improved Member ship, but must keep the results of the second roll.\n\nExpert\nYour authority extends to calling in a subordinate to support you. Once per day you may make a Communication (Persuasion) test. If you succeed, you can call in a subordinate from the organization you chose at the Novice rank to aid you. Use one of the profiles found in the Threats chapter. If your character is level 5-8, this subordinate can be no more than a Minor threat, called at a test TN of 11. If your character is level 9-12, you may choose a Moderate-threat subordinate instead, at a test TN of 13. If your character is level 13 or above, you have the option of a subordinate who’s a Major threat in their own right, if you succeed at a TN 15 test. You do not gain the novice re-roll benefit on this test.\n\nMaster\nBecause you have influence in your organization, you have constant access to resources. Add your Membership rank in the organization to your Income whenever you can call upon your organization. Further more, if your Income score decreases, you regain the lost point during the next interlude when you interact with the organization.\n\nGunfighter\nNo one shoots as quickly or as accurately as you.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nDexterity 2 and Accuracy 2 or higher.\n\nNovice\nYour accuracy is instinctive. Pick Accuracy (Pistols) or Accuracy (Rifles). You gain a +1 to attack and damage rolls for attacks made using your chosen focus.\n\nExpert\nYou’re fast and precise. You may pick the other focus from the Novice degree and apply the Novice benefit to it, or improve the bonus for the focus you picked at Novice rank to +2 to your attack and damage rolls.\n\nMaster\nYou’re one with the gun. Choose one of the following stunts: Lightning Attack, Overwatch, Lethal Blow, or Wound. You can perform the chosen stunt for 1 SP less than usual when wielding a firearm. In the case of Overwatch, spending 1 SP gives you the effects of spending 2 SP, and spending 2 SP gives you the 3 SP effect. See Chapter 5 for details on these stunts.\n\nHacker\nYou excel at the use and abuse of computer systems.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nIntelligence 2 or higher and the Intelligence (Technology) focus.\n\nNovice\nYou are skilled in navigating computer systems. Add +1 to Intelligence (Technology) tests.\n\nExpert\nWhen things go wrong or don’t work quite how you want them to, you’re skilled in finding backdoors and loopholes. You can perform the High Tech Hustle stunt for 2 SP. In advanced tests involving computer systems, add +1 to your Drama Die roll. This increases your total test result and allows you to complete advanced tests faster.\n\nMaster\nBreaking into a system is one thing, but getting in and then out without getting caught is another. While using a computer system, you may perform the Cover Your Tracks stunt for 1 SP. Add another +1 to your Drama Die result while performing advanced tests for a total of +2, otherwise the same as the Expert degree benefit.\n\nInvestigator\nYou’re a skilled detective.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nPerception and Intelligence 2 or higher and least one Perception focus.\n\nNovice\nYou can always make a test to unlock a lead, even if you don’t have a primary or tangential focus relevant to the investigation, although you take a +2 increase in TN when you don’t have either (see Investigation in Chapter 5 for details). If you do have a primary or tangential focus for the lead, you get a +1 bonus to the test with a primary focus (in addition to the focus bonus) and no increase in TN for using a tangential focus.\n\nExpert\nThe real trick to being a great investigator isn’t finding clues, it’s knowing how to use them. You may use the Intuition stunt for 1 SP. Furthermore, if you have the primary focus required to unlock a lead, add another +1 to your roll to do so for a total of +2.\n\nMaster\nWhen all the evidence is gathered, you only need a flash of inspiration to put it together and find the solution.

If the situation only requires a simple social maneuverer, add +1 to your roll.\n\nMaster\nWherever you go, you fit in with ease.

If this movement would expose the target to a hazard, such as pushing them off a ledge, roll an opposed test of your attacking ability versus the target’s Strength (Might) or Dexterity (Acrobatics), whichever is higher. If you lose the test, the target doesn’t move.\n\n1\nWhatever’s Handy\nImmediately arm yourself with anything in your environment you can reasonably wield as a makeshift weapon (see Makeshift Weapons in this Chapter 5 of The Expanse RPG).\n\n2+\nGroup Tactics\nChoose one ally to move 2 meters in a direction of their choosing for each 2 SP spent.\n\n2\nDouble-Team\nChoose one ally to make an immediate attack on your target, who must be within range and sight of the ally’s attack.\n\n2\nInjure\nIf your target has lost half or more of their Fortune, your attack imposes an injured condition so long as its damage exceeds the target’s Toughness.

Treat one irrelevant focus as a tangential one on the next test you make to unlock a lead related to this test.\n\n4\nDown the Rabbit Hole (Detailed)\nIf this test led to a reveal, the GM also provides a brand new lead about a new subject that will lead to greater rewards.\n\n5\nBreakthrough\nYou gain not only information but some form of incontrovertible proof (Simple); reduce the total number of leads on the path by one, jumping to a further point in the investigation immediately (Detailed).\n\nSocial Stunts\nAttitude Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1-3\nMaking an Offer\nYour test implies a promise or olive branch, temporarily shifting the target’s Attitude toward you up by one per SP spent (even if this test already shifted it); it shifts back by the same amount as soon as you fail a social test against them. Inapplicable when performing a grand gesture.\n\n1\nRead the Room\nThe GM reveals the current Attitude, or an intention or mood indicator, for one character present of your choice, in reaction to your test.

If you lied and the target later finds out, their Attitude toward you shifts to Very Hostile as well.\n\n5\nMeddle\nYour action brings others together or drives a wedge between them. Choose two other characters present and shift their Attitudes toward each other up or down by one (both in the same direction)\n\nGeneral Social Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1-3\nImpress\nGain a +1 per SP spent to your next social test against the same target as this test, during this encounter.\n\n1\nCards on the Table\nIf you were completely honest when making this test, your target must be completely honest in the next social test they make against you during this encounter. This doesn’t stop either character from omitting information or offering misleading truths.\n\n1\nMaking an Entrance\nIf this is your first action of the encounter, gain +1 to your next opposed roll against one character who witnessed it. You can choose this stunt multiple times per roll.\n\n2\nAnd Another Thing\nMake a second, related test as part of your action, before anyone else has a chance to respond or make any tests of their own.\n\n2\nHidden Message\nYour words convey a different message to one person than to everyone else who hears them; the character you choose is the only one who can decipher your true meaning.\n\n2\nSway the Crowd\nYour words affect one additional person of your choice. You may choose this stunt multiple times per roll, but if someone opposed your test you can’t expand the effect to anyone with a higher ability + focus total than the original target.\n\n3\nGood Cop/Bad Cop\nChoose an ally to immediately make a test in seeming opposition to the one you just made, with the same target. If they succeed, rather than garnering the usual results, they prompt the target to give up a secret you didn’t already know.\n\n3\nLet’s Make a Deal\nYour action turns out to benefit a character you didn’t target, who now owes you a favor, however grudgingly.\n\n3\nObjection!\nYou step in on someone else’s behalf. Another character in the scene may use your ability + focus score instead of their own next time they oppose a test during this encounter.\n\n4\nClass Clown\nYour words lighten the mood, imposing a –2 penalty to all enemies’ initiative rolls if a fight breaks out during this encounter.\n\n4\nFlirt\nRoll Communication (Seduction) vs. your target’s Willpower (Self-Discipline) as a simple social roll against a character whose Attitude toward you is Open or better, with a positive bent; if you win, they become enamoured with your character, opening the door to future romance or intimacy. How this proceeds is up to you and the GM to work out together.\n\n4\nFrom the Heart\nYou believe wholeheartedly in what you say. Choose one Willpower focus. If you don’t have it already, gain it for the rest of the encounter. If you do, it adds +3 instead of +2 to rolls you make with it.\n\n4\nSleep with One Eye Open\nApplies to a test targeting someone you have a negative Relationship with, or who has harmed someone you have a Relationship with. The next attack you make against that target in this session is automatically a surprise attack, as long as they weren’t already in combat.\n\n5\nEnrage\nChoose one character present whose Attitude toward you is Neutral or worse, or a negative variant of a more positive Attitude. They must immediately either attack you or storm out of the scene. If they attack, it needn’t be deadly, though it can be.\n\n5\nPatter\nYour rapid-fire words confuse your target, who must succeed at a Perception (Empathy) roll vs. your Communication (Deception), or automatically fail their next non-attack test against you.\n\n7\nMy Word is My Bond\nApplies to a test relevant to completing a task you’ve promised someone you have a Relationship with you’ll perform. Gain +2 to tests directly related to completing this task until the end of the session. This stunt requires bonus SP available from a Relationship in order to meet the necessary cost.\n\nMembership &amp; Reputation Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1\nBon Mot\nYou tag the perfect witty remark onto the end of your action. If you can’t think of one, let the group brainstorm and pick one among their ideas. Gain a temporary honorific you can use for passive Reputation only, for the rest of the session.\n\n1\nStick Your Neck Out\nYour test puts your own Reputation in jeopardy to help someone else. An ally of your choice gains a +2 bonus to their next social test in this encounter; if they fail, you lose all Reputation bonuses from one honorific for the rest of the session.\n\n2\nIn Good Standing\nWhen targeting a member of an organization in which you have Membership, treat your rank as one higher for purposes of gaining access to resources for the rest of this encounter.\n\n3\nBenefit of the Doubt\nYour action impresses or charms any one character present. Roll Communications (Persuasion) vs. Willpower (Self-Discipline) to affect someone with an Attitude of Hostile or worse; no roll is necessary for others. Increase all relevant Membership and Reputation bonuses by +1 while interacting with that character for the rest of the session; may improve their Attitude toward you, at the GM’s discretion.\n\n3\nGo Viral\nWhether via you or others sharing a video or audio recording, news gets out quickly about what you’ve just done. For the rest of the session, the honorific most related to this test applies even in situations where it seems unrelated.\n\n4\nOozing Confidence\nYour action impresses or fools all the right people. Gain one temporary Reputation honorific or rank of Membership for the rest of the session, or until you next fail a test relevant to this influence, whichever comes first.\n\n5\nName-dropping\nYour action displays your affiliation with someone whose Membership rank is higher than yours in an organization to which you belong, or who has a relevant honorific you don’t. You may use their Reputation or Membership benefits with that honorific or organization as your own for the rest of the session; if they find out and disapprove, worsen their Attitude toward you by one shift.\n\nProfession Stunts\nBounty Hunter Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1-4\nThe Upper Hand\nDuring the making contact encounter, you gain a bonus to your initiative test against your target equal to the SP spent (up to +4). This is a version of The Upper Hand exploration stunt unique to bounty hunting.\n\n2–6\nWhat Makes Them Tick\nYou get a real sense for your target and what motivates them; for your next social encounter with the target, you gain a bonus to all interaction tests equal to half the SP spent (up to +3 for 6 SP).\n\n5\nSaw That Coming\nWhen you make contact with your target, you can choose one thing that they do in response to you, when it happens, and retroactively declare you had previously prepared for it. So, for example, if the target ducks out the back exit, you can use this stunt to declare you have an ally waiting there for them. The GM approves your choice, and it can only involve resources reasonably at your disposal during the hunt.\n\nEntertainer Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1-3\n“I'm with the band!”\nBy telling people you’re a performer and implying—correctly or otherwise—that you are somehow part of the evening’s entertainment, you can get into just about any club, bar, concert hall, theatre, or other entertainment venue immediately and at no cost, even if they’re sold out. This also lets you get backstage, though it doesn’t necessarily grant access to guarded celebrities or restricted areas you have no business visiting (such as server rooms). The cost of this Stunt depends on how plausible your presence is; a grungy Belter musician famous for their hardcore Banger sound would spend 1 to get into a Belter concert venue, but that same musician claiming they’re part of the John Carter Follies musical revival at the Grand Red Opry on Mars would require at least 2 points, and saying they’re with the acclaimed Lunar Ballet production of Senza Peso is definitely going to cost 3 points. Note that the GM has the final say over whether this Stunt is plausible enough to apply to a situation.\n\n1-3\nRight in the Feels\nYou know how to read your audience and tune your performance for maximum impact. For each point spent on this Stunt, treat the number on the Drama Die as one higher for the purposes of determining the degree of success on a performance roll. Note that this does not change the actual die roll result, only the degree of success when relevant.\n\nJournalist Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1-3\nHardball\nYou are adept at asking tough questions and getting honest answers, even if it ruffles some feathers. You may spend SP to impose a -1 penalty on Deception tests for anyone who tries to lie to you during questioning. You may also force an opponent to re-roll a Deception test, but you must abide by this new result, and their Attitude shifts a degree less favourable toward you afterward.\n\n2+\nFourth Estate\nYou temporarily gain a rank of Membership in an organization you’ve been covering or researching, with the rank equal to the SP spent -1. This lasts for the rest of the session. You are not actually a member, but you’ve gained enough trust of those in the organization that as long as you don’t violate their rules, they will take you under their wing for a time.\n\n3\nPress Pass\nBy announcing yourself as a member of the press and presenting appropriate credentials, you can gain access to a restricted area or situation where a member of the press might plausibly be admitted (even if it’s unlikely). You probably can’t convince the MCRN to let you waltz onto a battleship currently preparing for battle, for example, but you might be able to get on base to speak to a commander during an alert.\n\nVehicle Combat\nVehicle Combat Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1-3\nSystem Damage\nYour attack damages the vehicle’s Handling, Sensors, or Weapons. Impose a –1 penalty per SP spent to the damaged ability (up to 3). This penalty remains until the vehicle is repaired. Damage control with a TN 13 Intelligence (Engineering) test can negate (but not remove) the penalty for rounds equal to the Drama Die result. If the ability is reduced below –2, the vehicle automatically fails tests calling for it. If Handling is reduced below –2 the vehicle is out of control and helpless.\n\n1+\nPenetrate Hull\nYour attack overcomes the vehicle’s resistance to damage. If a vehicle has a Hull rating, you must spend SP equal to it on this stunt before spending SP on other stunts.\n\n2\nOff-Course\nThe vehicle is thrown off-course and the operator must make a TN 15 test to maintain control. A new test can be made each round to regain control if it is lost.\n\n2\nScuttle\nYour attack destroys the target vehicle. This stunt is only available against a helpless vehicle.\n\n2+\nShrapnel\nThe attack causes a damaging explosion in the vehicle’s interior. The operator and all passengers in the same compartment suffer 1d6 damage for 2 SP or 2d6 damage for 4 SP.\n\n3+\nHull Breach\nYou inflict significant damage to the vehicle, reducing its Hull rating by 1 per 3 SP spent. The loss of Hull rating lasts until repaired.\n\n3\nSlowdown\nYou damage the vehicle’s propulsion, dropping its Speed class by one category. If it drops to Slow or less, the operator must make a TN 15 test to maintain control. The slowdown remains until repaired. Damage control with a TN 13 Intelligence (Engineering) test can negate (but not remove) the penalty for rounds equal to the Drama Die result.\n\n4\nDisable Drive\nYour attack disables the vehicle’s propulsion. The operator must make a TN 15 test to maintain control and, even if they succeed, must deal with a vehicle that can no longer move or maneuver under its own power. The vehicle is helpless. Damage control with a TN 13 Intelligence (Engineering) test can restore the vehicle’s Speed at one degree lower than usual for rounds equal to the Drama Die result.\n\n4+\nSkewer\nYour attack is in just the right place to do serious damage inside the vehicle: One character suffers 4d6 damage for 4 SP, or 6d6 damage for 6 SP, or the full damage of your weapon +2d6, whichever is less.\n\n5\nRupture\nYour attack ruptures a fuel line or power conduit, causing an internal explosion. This deals 3d6 penetrating damage to everyone in a particular compartment of the vehicle and also causes the effects of either a System Damage (3 SP) or Slowdown stunt.\n\n6\nDisable Engine\nYour attack disables the vehicle’s engine or main power, such as a ship’s reactor, causing the effect of a Disable Drive stunt and leaving the vehicle completely without power other than emergency back-ups and essentially helpless. Damage control with a TN 13 Intelligence (Engineering) test can restore power for rounds equal to the Drama Die result. Otherwise the power remains offline until repaired.\n\nSpace Combat: Command Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1+\nGuidance\nYou grant a +1 bonus to a chosen ship combat test this round for each 1 SP you spend. Choose one of the following: manoeuvre test, electronic warfare test, evasion test, point defence test, or damage control test.\n\n1+\nBlinding Manoeuvre\nYou manoeuvre your ship in such a way as to blind or limit an opponent’s Sensors. Each SP you spend reduces an opposing ship’s Sensors score by 1 (to a minimum score of –2) until the start of the next round.\n\n2\nMulti-Targeting\nYour ship’s point defence cannons (if any) can both attack and defend this round without any penalty (see Point Defence under Defensive Actions, following).\n\n2+\nOn-Target\nEvery 2 SP you spend increases the TN of tests to evade your ship’s weapon attacks that round by +1.\n\n2+\nTactics\nEvery 2 SP you spend increase the TN of an opposing ship commander’s next command test by +1.\n\n3+\nEvasive Action\nEvery 3 SP you spend grants a +1d6 Hull bonus to your ship that round for resisting damage from successful weapon attacks.\n\n3\nPerceived Weakness\nYou increase the damage of one successful weapon attack by 1d6. This stunt is a risk, as it has to come in Step 5 of the round, and requires a successful hit.\n\n3+\nEvasive Action\nGrants a +1d6 Hull bonus to your ship that round for resisting damage from successful weapon attacks.\n\n3+\nCalculation\nYou can bank the SP you just spent for this stunt +1 and use them on a later stunt. You can also combine these SP with future SP earned.\n\n4\nPrecise Hit\nOne of your successful weapon attacks results in an additional Loss, even if the target’s Hull completely eliminated the damage.\n\n4\nSkimming\nIf a space battle takes place near a planet with an atmosphere, you can dive into the planet’s atmosphere to avoid being targeted and perhaps even lose your pursuer completely.Your pilot must make an opposed TN 17 Dexterity (Piloting) test to succeed:Success -&gt; the pursuing ship loses track of your ship in the atmosphere, at least temporarily.On following rounds, the pursuing ship can make opposed TN 11 Intelligence (Technology) + Sensors tests to reacquire a target on your ship.\n\n4\nToo Close\nTo perform this stunt, you must be engaged against multiple enemy ships and at close range to one that is of at least one size class larger. A space station can also count as a larger ship.The pilot manoeuvres into a position that makes it difficult for enemies to target your ship without risking damage to the other ship.During the Manoeuvre phase, the pilot must make a successful opposed TN 15 Dexterity (Piloting) test against the larger ship at -2. The difficulty is reduced by 1 for every additional size class greater the enemy ship is than the crew’s ship:- Success à the pilot gains a+2 to their evasion test against any ships other than the ship they are using for cover- Any attacks that miss the crew’s ship hit the larger ship if the pilot rolls a 5 or 6 on the Drama Die.- If both ships fail the piloting test à the ships collide, causing 2d6 damage to the larger ship and 4d6 damage to the smaller ship.\n\n4+\nSet-Up\nYou manoeuvre an opposing ship into a hazard, such as a normally shorter range weapon, a field of debris, or even a floating rock. This stunt is considered a weapon attack inflicting damage dice equal to half the SP spent (round down). The Set-Up can be evaded; the TN is 10 + your Intelligence + Leadership focus (if any) + half the SP spent. So if a character with Intelligence 2 and Leadership spends 5 SP on this stunt, the TN to evade the Set-Up is (10 + 2 + 2 + 2.5, rounded down to 2) or 16, and a failure on the evasion test results in 2d6 damage to the target ship.\n\n5\nBurn Them\nAn Epstein drive emits a powerful drive plume that can, in a pinch, be used as a weapon. To do this successfully, the ship must be at close range and perform a sudden flip and burn that points the drive plume directly at the enemy ship.The ships must be at extremely close range, so this manoeuvre can’t be used in normal engagements - only if circumstances have dictated that the ships are very close (under 1 km). Unfortunately, this manoeuvre leaves the crew’s ship vulnerable and open to attack.To successfully perform this manoeuvre, the pilot must also make a successful opposed TN 19 Dexterity (Piloting) test against the other ship at -2. If successful, the other ship is engulfed in your drive plume, causing 6d6 damage. The downside is that only rear-facing weapons can fire while the ship performs this manoeuvre, and enemy ships have a +2 to their evasion tests. Also, due to being in an exposed position, all evasion tests are at -2. If the pilot fails this test, they fail to engulf the enemy ship with the drive plume but still suffer all of the associated penalties.\n\n5\nWeapon Online\nOne of the crew can temporarily bring a damaged weapon, or a weapon that has run out of ammo, back online.A character can attempt a TN 14 Intelligence (Engineering) or Dexterity (Gunnery) test to bring a weapon back online.The weapon can make 1d3 shots before giving up the ghost for good, requiring a proper repair. The weapon cannot be brought back online again without the ship receiving full maintenance at a spaceport.\n\n6\nQuick Start\nThe crew can attempt to make a quick repair and restart the ship’s reactor.This requires two characters to work together; one must make a TN 14 Intelligence (Technology) test and another must make a TN 14 Intelligence (Engineering) test, and they must reach a threshold of 15.\n\n7\nMisdirect\nWhen attempting to outrun a torpedo, you can fly close to another ship to try to get the torpedo to hit that ship instead of your own. You perform a flip and burn when near another ship.The pilot must make a successful opposed Dexterity (Piloting) test against the other ship and another member of the crew must make a TN 17 Technology (Intelligence) test. If both are successful, the torpedo impacts the other ship instead.\n\nSpace Combat: Piloting Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1+\nBlinding Manoeuvre\nReduces an opposing ship’s Sensors score by 1 (to a minimum score of –2) until the start of the next round.\n\n2+\nSteady as She Goes\nPilot can lessen the potential high-g manoeuvres damage to passengers. For every 2 SP spent the TN for the Constitution (Stamina) test is reduced by 1.\n\n3+\nEvasive Action\nGrants a +1d6 Hull bonus to your ship that round for resisting damage from successful weapon attacks.\n\n4\nBlockade\nThe pilot manoeuvres the ship to make it difficult for an enemy ship to fire on or pursue its chosen target (unless that target is the pilot’s ship).The enemy ship suffers a -2 penalty to any manoeuvre test to pursue or attack its original target. Or the targeted ship gets a +2 to its evasion test.\n\n4+\nSet-up\nYou manoeuvre an opposing ship into a hazard, such as a normally shorter-range weapon, a field of debris, or even a floating rock.This stunt is considered a weapon attack inflicting damage dice equal to half the SP spent (round down).Can be evaded with the TN = 10 + your Intelligence + Leadership focus (if any) + half the SP spent\n\nSpace Combat: Electronic Warfare Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1+\nEye Patch\nReduce the TN of a damage control test to repair a loss to Sensors by 1 for each SP spent.\n\n1+\nEat Static\nYou adjust your ship’s active emissions in a way that makes it harder to target, adding +SP to your ship’s next electronic warfare test.\n\n2+\nTurnabout is Fair Play\nIf a torpedo is being manually controlled, the sensors operator can attempt to wrest control of the torpedo from the other ship. If there is more than one torpedo, 2 SP can be spent to attempt to control each.Opposed Intelligence (Technology) + Sensors test against the enemy ship.\n\n3\nExploitable Terrain\nIf you are near appropriate exploitable terrain (asteroid field, dust cloud), you spot a path near or through it that the pilot (whether you or another character) can use as protective cover. Immediately trigger either the Evasive Manoeuvre or Follow the Leader chase stunt.\n\n3\nPerceived weakness\nYou increase the damage of one successful weapon attack by 1d6.\n\n4\nHack the System\nWhile scanning the enemy ship for weaknesses, the sensors operator detects an opening in the enemy ship’s computer system. They can attempt to hack the enemy’s ship to temporarily disable one or more systems. To do this, a PC must make an opposed Intelligence (Technology) + Sensors test against the enemy ship. If successful, they can shut down one system on that ship (weapons, sensors, engines, etc.). They remain offline until someone on the enemy ship makes a successful TN 15 Intelligence (Technology) test.\n\nSpace Combat: Weapons Officer Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n2\nMulti-targeting\nPBCs can both attack and defend this round without any penalty.\n\n2+\nOn-target\nIncreases the TN of tests of your opponent to evade your ship’s weapon attacks that round by +1.\n\n4\nPrecise hit\nOne successful weapon attack results in an additional Loss, even if the target’s Hull completely eliminated the damage\n\nSpace Combat: Engineer Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1+\nNot My Ship!\nThe Engineer can spend Fortune to reduce damage taken by the ship just as it were part of the hull. The engineer can spend 1d6 Fortune to reduce damage to the ship for every SP spent.\n\n3+\nQuick Fix\nEvery 3 SP spent allows the engineer to instantly repair a single loss to Manoeuvrability, Sensors, or Weapons.\n\n4\nPatch\nThe ship’s engineer can apply a quick weld job to temporarily reinforce hull damage. Attempt a TN 17 Intelligence (Engineering) test to make the patch. If successful, the temporarily remove hull losses up to the number rolled on the Drama Die by the engineer. This patch only lasts until the end of the combat, and the ship must then receive proper maintenance at a spaceport.\n\n5\nWeapon Online\nOne of the crew can temporarily bring a damaged weapon, or a weapon that has run out of ammo, back online.A character can attempt a TN 14 Intelligence (Engineering) or Dexterity (Gunnery) test to bring a weapon back online.The weapon can make 1d3 shots before giving up the ghost for good, requiring a proper repair. The weapon cannot be brought back online again without the ship receiving full maintenance at a spaceport.\n\n6\nQuick Start\nThe crew can attempt to make a quick repair and restart the ship’s reactor.This requires two characters to work together; one must make a TN 14 Intelligence (Technology) test and another must make a TN 14 Intelligence (Engineering) test, and they must reach a threshold of 15.",

When you lead NPCs in an encounter, they do not have to make a Willpower (Morale) test until more than two-thirds of your side’s combatants are out of the fight (dead or incapacitated). If you leave the fight or are taken out, this benefit is lost.\nNPCs do not need to take a morale <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Focuses</a> test\n\nContacts\nYou have a large web of social connections, and know people even in the unlikeliest places.\n\nCategory\nDetail\nEffect\n\nRequirements\nCommunication 1 or higher\n\nNovice\nYou can attempt to make a contact out of an NPC with a Neutral or better attitude toward you with a successful Communication (Persuasion) test. The GM sets the target number based on the likelihood of you knowing the character or having mutual friends. The more distant the character’s origin or social class from yours, the more difficult the test. If you succeed, the new contact’s attitude shifts one step in your favour and they readily provide information without a test, as long as it wouldn’t harm them. They will not perform other favours without further persuasion.\nmake contact out of NPC\n\nExpert\nOnce you’ve established a contact, you can try to get a favour from them with a single successful Communication (Persuasion) test, regardless of their attitude toward you and without engaging in a complex social interaction. The target number is based on the nature of the favour and whether it puts the contact in any danger.\ncontact favour out of persuasion test\n\nMaster\nYour social skills can turn a contact into an trusted ally. If you do a significant favour for an established contact, they become Very Friendly towards you, and any potential risk in the favours you ask of them does not affect the target number of the Communication (Persuasion) test from the Expert degree. If they’re already Very Friendly, they become zealously loyal; you do not need to make an ability test to ask favours of them, regardless of the danger involved, and the GM can use your ally to provide prompts if you become stuck in the course of a story in the form of unsolicited advice or favours. Allies’ attitudes can degrade if they’re not treated well, but do not do so simply with the passage of time. You can drift apart for a decade and they’ll still be as loyal as when you last met.\nsignificant favour turns contact into ally\n\nDoctor\nYou have the skills to heal wounds and treat illness and other conditions.\n\nCategory\nDetail\nEffect\n\nRequirements\nIntelligence (Medicine) focus\n\nNovice\nYou’re skilled in treating patients.

With an hour and a basic TN 11 Intelligence (Medicine) test you can remove a wounded condition, leaving the patient only injured (see Conditions in Chapter 1). You can also remove other medical-related conditions with proper time and treatment, at the GM’s discretion, using the Interlude guide lines in Chapter 5.\nremove condition with TN11 medicine test\n\nMaster\nYou can perform complex medical procedures to restore a patient to a normal, healthy condition, and you can re-roll any failed Intelligence (Medicine) test, but must keep the result of the second roll.

You can make an ability test that requires a specific focus, even if you don’t have that focus. You don’t gain the focus bonus to your roll and don’t generate SP on such rolls, but in investigations you are always considered to have a tangential focus (see Investigation Focuses in Chapter 5).\nmake ability tests without required focus\n\nExpert\nAnything is a potential weapon or a tool in your hands. When you perform the Whatever’s Handy combat stunt, the penalty of your makeshift weapon is reduced by 1 and it lasts 2d6 rounds before breaking. If improvising a tool instead of a weapon, you can perform tests that require the tool, but you don’t generate SP while doing so.\nWhatever’s Handy <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/diomedes-spear/rules/stunts/#combat-stunts\">Stunts#Combat Stunts</a> -1 to penalty &amp; last 2d6 rounds\n\nMaster\nYou can turn failure into some measure of success. If you roll doubles on a failed test, you generate SP equal to the result of the Drama Die –2 (minimum 1). The test still fails, but you can try to salvage the situation with a stunt you perform with the SP you gain. Unfortunately, your stunt cannot achieve your original intended action. The GM determines if the desired stunt is permitted, based on the situation.\nGenerate SP on failed tests\n\nInspire\nYour words and presence motivate others to action. The benefits of Inspire do not stack, if you happen to have multiple characters on the same side who have it, other than their ability to continue inspiring their side after one or more of them has been taken out.\n\nCategory\nDetail\nEffect\n\nRequirements\nCommunication 2 or higher\n\nNovice\nYou inspire your friends and allies.

Choose one of the following Communication focuses: Deception, Etiquette, or Seduction. If you fail a Communication test with your chosen focus, you can re-roll it but must keep the result of the second roll.\nre-roll chosen communication\n\nExpert\nYou can squeeze information from the most reluctant sources. If the focus you chose in the Novice degree is considered a tangential focus during an investigation (see Chapter 5), you ignore the +2 increase to the TN of the test. In addition, if you use the focus you chose in the Novice degree to successfully complete a task in a complex social interaction, you clear two shifts instead of only one.\nsocial interactions give two shifts\n\nMaster\nThe secrets you know can raise or ruin anyone’s good standing. You can perform the Cast Out and Oozing Confidence social stunts for 1 SP lower than their normal cost. In addition, you can use Oozing Confidence to benefit another character.\n-1 SP for cast out and oozing confidence <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/diomedes-spear/rules/stunts/#social-stunts\">Stunts#Social Stunts</a>.

For example, using Intelligence (Business) instead of Communication (Persuasion) to convince a corporate middle-manager to agree with you. If this would be a tangential investigation focus, you do not suffer the +2 use intel focus at -1\nreplace needed focus with intelligence focus with -1 penalty\n\nExpert\nYou leverage every bit of information.

See Advanced Tests in Chapter 1 for details.\n+1 DD for research test\n\nMaster\nPick any two of your knowledge focuses.

You can also imitate a specific dialect with a successful Communication (Performance) test.\n\nMaster\nYou learn three additional languages for a total of six plus your native language(s). You can also pick any one additional language you know and speak it like a native—that is, without any trace of an accent.\n\nMaker\nMake-it-yourself is your motto and you use manufacturing focuses to do just that. Use Dexterity (Craft) for most hand crafted and artistic items and Intelligence (Engineering) for most technological items. The GM may approve other manufacturing focuses as appropriate for certain items.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nAny manufacturing focus (see below)\n\nNovice\nYou can use a manufacturing focus to make any item with the appropriate tools and access to a work shop.

This includes saving a patient from dying and reviving an unconscious character.\n\nExpert\nIf you treat a patient, you can alleviate the effects of the exhausted, fatigued, injured, or wounded conditions. This takes an advanced TN 11 Intelligence (Medicine) test (threshold 5) with each roll taking one minute. If you succeed, the patient ignores the effects of those conditions for 1d6 hours. The conditions are still present, however, and the effects return when the duration ends or if any of the conditions worsen, such as an injured character becoming wounded, for example.\n\nMaster\nYou can quickly treat wounds to prevent them from becoming serious. If you treat a wounded condition within an hour of it occurring, you can make a basic TN 13 Intelligence (Medicine) test. Success down grades the wounded condition to injured.\n\nMisdirection\nYou can sow confusion among friends and foes alike.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nCommunication (Deception) focus\n\nNovice\nAs a major action, you can make a Communication (Deception) test opposed by an opponent’s Will power (Self-Discipline); if you succeed, your opponent cannot perform stunts until the end of your next turn.\n\nExpert\nYour targets become too focused on you to do anything else. When you use the Over Here! exploration stunt, the bonus your allies gain is +2 instead of +1, and you gain a +1 bonus yourself.\n\nMaster\nWhen you use a Communication focus in combat and roll doubles, you gain +1 SP.\n\nObservation\nYou have an eye for detail.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nPerception 2 or higher\n\nNovice\nYou notice things others do not.

On a successful Perception test, you can spend 2 SP to make a second, immediate Perception test with the same TN but with a different focus than the first, and gain additional information (if any) from a successful test with the second focus. This includes additional information when you uncover the clue within a lead.\n\nMaster\nNothing escapes your scrutiny.

If you make a successful Communication (Persuasion) test when addressing a group and the result of your Drama Die is 5 or 6, you rouse them to immediate action. You can’t necessarily control what they do, though you can try to do so with Communication (Leadership) tests, but they take your words to heart and act on them regardless.\npersuasion test &amp; DD 5 or 6 -&gt; rouse crowd to immediate action\n\nPerformance\nYou have a talent for the performing arts.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nCommunication (Performing) focus\n\nNovice\nChoose a form of performance art, such as playing a musical instrument, singing, acting, dancing, miming, stand-up comedy, juggling, or any other art performed in front of an audience. You are an accomplished performer in your chosen art. In addition, you may perform the From the Heart and Sway the Crowd stunts for 1 SP less than their normal cost.\n\nExpert\nYou can add an additional form of performance. You get a feel for a room and adapt accordingly. If you have at least 15 minutes to observe a crowd before performing or speaking in front of them, you gain a +1 bonus to any Communication-based tests to persuade or entertain them. You can also choose a number of individuals in the crowd equal to your Perception (minimum 1); at the end of the 15 minutes of observation you know their initial attitudes toward you, and you know if they changed by the end of your performance and, if so, by how much.\n\nMaster\nYou can add an additional form of perfor mance to your repertoire. When performing, you exude confidence and style.

The second attack cannot generate stunt points, and you only add half of your Strength (rounded down) to damage.\n\nGrappling Style\nYou’re skilled in restraining and subduing opponents in unarmed combat.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nFighting (Grappling) focus\n\nNovice\nIf you fail an opposed Fighting (Grappling) test to avoid being grappled, as per the Grapple stunt’s description in Chapter 5, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll.\n\nExpert\nIf you successfully hit an opponent with an unarmed attack and choose a stunt from the Grappling category, you gain 1 additional SP to apply.\n\nMaster\nYou can perform the Pin stunt for 3 SP instead of the usual 4.

You can also generate stunt points with this test, unlike a normal initiative roll, and spend them on general combat or gun stunts.\n\nMaster\nWhen hitting a target with a shot from a pistol, you can add your Dexterity to the damage total.\n\nRifle Style\nA rifle is far more dangerous in your hands.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nAccuracy (Rifles) focus\n\nNovice\nYou can assume a highly ready stance; as long as you are not moving more than half your normal speed, you can make an attack with a loaded rifle you are holding as a reaction before rolling initiative, even if surprised. This attack uses up your major action for the round, which means that you only have a minor action available during your next turn.\n\nExpert\nYou ignore 2 points of any armour bonus provided by cover when using a longarm or assault rifle.
