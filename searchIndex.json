		"content": "Variance from TV\nOur universe is more closely aligned with the books timeline. This is how it varies from the TV timeline.\nTiming\nAfter Eros crashed into Venus, there was around six months of peace before the events around Ganymede kick off.\nCeres\nAround the time Miller left Ceres the UN withdrew from Ceres due to riots. The OPA is now in charge of Ceres, with Anderson Dawes the Governor in all. It name.\nStar Helix (an Earth company) no longer has the security contract, although many of the former Star Helix employees are now employed by the Ceres Security service.\nThe Belt\nThe UN also withdrew from The Belt, returning all UNN Belt assets to the protection of Earth. The UNN still has a Jupiter Fleet which protects Earth's interests in the Jovian and Saturnian systems.\nDuring this time Tycho Station contracted the Rocinante to help fill the power vacuum, especially patrolling for pirates.\nCharacters\nFred Johnson and Anderson Dawes\nAt this stage, their relationship is not as antagonised as it is the the TV Show. They are rival within the OPA, but are not in open conflict with each other.\nPaolo Cortázar (Protogen scientist)\nThere was many scientists who survived the belters' raid on Thoth station. All these scientists were taken and jailed at three different black sites throughout the Belt. None were taken to Tyco Station.\nJules-Pierre Mao\nWhile elements of the UN were aware of Jules-Pierre Mao's involvement with the protomolicule, this know is not yet public.\nDrummer\nThe Drummer TV show character is a composite of four different characters from the books (Michio Pa, Bull, Samara Rosenberg and Drummer). Since it will be easier, and because she is just so damn awesome, the TV Version of Drummer will exist in our universe.\n\nPublic knowledge\nBelow is a listing of what you (as a member of the public living on Ceres) would know about the events of Leviathan Wakes (Seasons 1, 2 and part of 3).\nDestruction of The Cant\nSome guy called James Holden made a system wide broadcast claiming that The Canterbury (a Pur n Clean ice hauler) has been destroyed. He tied the attack to Mars. The Martian government publicly denied these claims.\nThe loss of the Cant and it's scheduled load of ice meant that the tight water rationing became even tighter.\nAnger over the Inner's destruction of a Belter ship as well as the impact of the increased water restrictions resulted in riots in Ceres.\nDestruction of the Donnager\nShortly after the destruction of The Cant, and around the same location, the MCRN Donnager was also destroyed. The Donnager was the largest warship ever made, and it's destruction sent shockwave around the solar system.\nThe Martian Congressional Republic initially accused the OPA for the destruction of the Donnager. But doubts about the the OPA's capacity to produce stealth ships lead to increased suspicions that Earth was the culprit.\nMany Martian commentators were publicly calling for Mars to go to war with Earth.\nUN withdrawal from Ceres\nWhilst the UNN had a numbers advantage over the MCRN, one-on-one the MCRN ship were far superior. With the increased likelihood of war breaking out, the UNN withdrew from Ceres and the Belt to shore up their Jovian and Home fleets.\nThe power vacuum left by the UN withdrawal from Ceres was filled by the OPA. Anderson Dawes became the de factor governor of Ceres. Dawes terminated the Ceres Security contract with Star Helix (an Earth based company) and handed it to the OPA. Many former Star Helix employees transferred to OPA security.\nMany Earth-based companies withdrew from Ceres, sending it's economy into recession.\nEros Incident\nA few months after the destruction of The Cant, a ship exploded in Eros Station's docks, creating in a huge radiation leak on board and leading to in going into full lockdown. As per usual procedure the station was placed under full quarantine by the UNN and the MCRN.\nRumours started circulating about what happened on Eros, ranging from terrorist attack through to biological weapons experiment. These rumours were further fuelled when some Belters discovered audio broadcasts from the station. Throughout the belt there were feeds that streamed these almost surreal broadcasts, containing seemingly disjointed words. These broadcasts were sampled and remixed into music creating a new genre called New Banger.\nWithout warning Eros moved, like it was turned into a spaceship. It started accelerating towards the inner planets, and eventually crashed into Venus. At this point the broadcasts ceased.",

		"content": "Current Day\n\n6\n\nA Campaign for The Expanse RPG\n“The Belt bleeds, and the Inners sip champagne on Titan.”\nSix months have passed since Eros burned across the system and plunged into Venus. The stars haven’t looked right since.\nThe UN and the MCRN point guns at each other while retreating from their outposts in the Belt, leaving behind a power vacuum—and an opportunity. On Ceres, Anderson Dawes is calling for Belters to stand for themselves, to protect their own from pirates, criminals, and the vultures that circle in corporate suits.\nYou are a crew of freelancers, survivors, and exiles drawn into a fragile alliance under Dawes’ watchful eye. You’ve been asked to do what the Inners never would: look after your own. Enforce justice in a place where the laws are written in dust. You’ll root out smugglers, uncover hidden agendas, and tangle with black-budget ghosts that should have stayed buried.\nAnd somewhere in the dark, something is stirring—something colder than vacuum, and older than Mars.\nThis is Diomedes’ Spear—a story of loyalty, betrayal, and survival in a solar system coming apart at the seams.\nBuckle in, Beltawala. Time to choose who you bleed for.",

		"content": "OPA Crackdown on Black Marketeers in the Belt\nBy Aanya Patel, Senior Correspondent - Tycho Free News\nCERES – The Outer Planets Alliance (OPA) has launched a system-wide crackdown on black market trade, targeting smuggling, illegal weapons, and human trafficking. As the OPA seeks to solidify its authority post-UN withdrawal, security teams have raided key hubs on Ceres, arresting dozens and seizing contraband.\nOPA security chief Carlos &quot;Bull&quot; de Baca led operations that dismantled arms smuggling networks supplying rogue factions. One major raid in the Pallas corridor resulted in a firefight, leaving several smugglers dead. However, not all OPA factions support the effort—some fear it disrupts vital supply chains, while others resent the shift toward centralized control.\nCriminal networks are adapting, rerouting operations to less-patrolled regions. Reports from Ganymede reveal forced labour rings exploiting refugees, prompting OPA intervention, though critics argue some factions previously ignored these abuses for profit. Meanwhile, independent haulers report increased scrutiny, claiming they are unfairly targeted by security patrols.\nWith illicit trade routes disrupted, Martian and UN-backed corporations are moving to fill the void, offering “OPA-approved” contracts that some Belters view as economic control by the Inners. Whether the OPA can maintain this crackdown or if internal divisions will weaken enforcement remains uncertain.\n\nMCRN Fleet Movements Signal Mars' Intentions in the Belt\nBy James Addai, Bennett-Halabi Information Services (BHIS)\nCALLISTO – The Martian Congressional Republic Navy (MCRN) has expanded its military presence in the outer planets, deploying warships to key locations in the Belt and Jovian system. Officially a &quot;strategic realignment,&quot; analysts suggest Mars is asserting influence in the wake of the Eros Incident.\nAt least two Donnager-class battleships and several Scirocco-class cruisers have been stationed near Ganymede and Callisto, with patrols extending into OPA-controlled space. While Martian officials insist the move is for regional security, critics argue it is a direct challenge to Belt autonomy.\nOPA spokesperson Michio Pa called the redeployment “a thinly veiled power play” and warned against “unwarranted Inner interference.” Anderson Dawes, however, urged caution, questioning whether Mars seeks stability or dominance. Meanwhile, the UN has increased patrols but avoided direct confrontation, with backchannel talks reportedly underway.\nWith tensions rising and Ganymede a focal point, Mars’ next move will determine whether this buildup leads to stability—or a dangerous new phase of conflict in the outer system.\n\nInvestigative Scoop - Plague and Profits: Is Kruger-Thompson Covering Up a Deadly Outbreak on Mathilde Station?\nBy Ren Xiaodan, Investigative Reporter - Tycho Free News\nMATHILDE STATION, THE BELT – Whispers of sickness have been circulating through the Belt, but recent reports suggest that Mathilde Station—one of Kruger-Thompson Mining’s largest asteroid operations—has been hit by a serious outbreak of haemorrhagic fever. Despite these claims, KTM has repeatedly denied the existence of any health crisis, dismissing concerns as nothing more than OPA and union propaganda tied to an ongoing labour dispute.\nYet, according to multiple sources inside Mathilde Station, the truth may be far more dire than corporate statements suggest.\nIn the past several weeks, Belter laborers on Mathilde Station have reported increasing cases of severe illness, marked by high fever, uncontrolled bleeding, and organ failure—symptoms consistent with haemorrhagic fever. Access to corporate medical facilities has been restricted, with sick workers being quarantined in the overcrowded Labourers’ Commons, an area of the station known for its poor air circulation and limited sanitation facilities.\nA maintenance technician who requested anonymity, fearing reprisal from corporate security, told Tycho Free News:\n&quot;Mi fong sick crewmates lie in their bunks, bleeding from the eyes, and the corp doctors? They na coming. They lock doors, keep the sick away, act like nothing happen. But people still dying.&quot;\nDespite these first-hand accounts, KTM’s official stance remains unchanged.\nIn a statement to Tycho Free News, KTM Corporate Liaison Director Amira DuPont dismissed concerns:\n&quot;There is no verified outbreak on Mathilde Station. Our company medical teams have found no evidence of a widespread health crisis beyond minor seasonal illnesses. These baseless rumours are being spread by union agitators and OPA extremists to disrupt operations and push their political agenda.&quot;\nBut if the situation is truly under control, why are workers still reporting severe symptoms? And why has no independent medical team been allowed to assess the station?\nThe Church of Humanity Ascendant, a religious movement known for its humanitarian aid efforts, has called for immediate intervention to address what they describe as an unfolding humanitarian crisis.\n&quot;We have received distressing reports from Mathilde Station indicating a major outbreak of hemorrhagic fever among the workforce,&quot; said Reverend Elias Khatri, a spokesperson for the church. &quot;If these reports are accurate, the situation requires immediate action. We urge Kruger-Thompson Mining to allow independent medical teams to assess and contain the outbreak before it spreads further.&quot;\nThe church, along with several Belter advocacy groups, has pledged to send medical personnel and relief supplies, but so far, KTM has not responded to their offers.\nMany workers believe the outbreak is no accident.\nMathilde Station has been at the heart of an escalating labour dispute between Kruger-Thompson Mining and its workforce, with workers rejecting a new contract filled with draconian terms that would reduce wages, extend work hours, and strip away safety protections.\n&quot;We were organizing. We were ready to push back,&quot; said one Belter labour leader who spoke to Tycho Free News on condition of anonymity. &quot;Then the sickness started. Now we too weak to fight, too scared to gather, and KTM acts like we making it up. Tell me that na convenient for them.&quot;\nSome within the station’s underground resistance movement suspect foul play, citing unverified evidence that station administrator Olivia Lund may have had prior knowledge of the outbreak before cases were publicly reported.\nDespite multiple attempts to reach Administrator Lund for comment, she has not responded to inquiries.\nWith Kruger-Thompson refusing independent investigation, workers growing desperate, and outside humanitarian groups demanding access, the situation on Mathilde Station is on the verge of boiling over.\nIf a full-scale outbreak is confirmed, it could spread beyond the station, endangering supply chains, nearby settlements, and potentially the entire Belt.\nAs of now, Kruger-Thompson Mining continues to control all information coming in and out of Mathilde Station. With reports of increased security patrols and restricted communications, many fear that by the time the truth is fully revealed, it will be too late.\n\nPiracy on the Rise in the Outer Planets: A Growing Threat to Trade\nBy Thaddeus Vonn, Far Olympus Enterprises\nJOVIAN SYSTEM — As tensions rise across the system, piracy is surging in the outer planets, threatening trade routes and economic stability. Reports from corporate security forces and independent traders confirm an increase in ship hijackings, cargo thefts, and station attacks, particularly beyond Saturn.\nRecent incidents include:\n\nFreighter Veles ambushed in the Saturnian corridor, its crew left adrift while its cargo was stolen.\nRCE transport convoy attacked near Pallas, losing fuel reserves.\nIce haulers near Uranus hijacked, signaling a shift toward resource raids.\n\nAuthorities suspect organized factions rather than random raiders. Groups like The Pallas Marauders and Dead Echo Fleet have been linked to recent attacks, with some corporations fearing rogue backers may be funding them.\nMartian and UN forces claim they are increasing patrols, but independent traders argue that military attention is elsewhere, leaving commercial vessels vulnerable. Rising piracy has led to higher shipping costs, disrupted supply chains, and rerouted trade routes, increasing economic pressure.\nCorporations and OPA factions are weighing responses, from corporate security fleets and bounty incentives to armed trade convoys. Yet, as one Belter captain put it, &quot;The wolves are out, and no one is stopping them.&quot;\n\nIndependent Journalist Uncovers Evidence of UN Bioweapons Program\nBy Kellen Dax, Pyramid News Network (PNN)\nLUNA— Investigative journalist Myra Benali has released what she claims are leaked documents exposing Project Persephone, a classified UN bioweapons program. While the UN denies these allegations, the report suggests that secret research into genetic modification agents and pathogen-based warfare has been underway for years.\nThe leaked files, allegedly obtained from a high-level source, describe a shift from defensive countermeasures to offensive biological applications amid rising tensions with Mars. Documents reference:\n\nTargeted bio-agents affecting specific genetic markers\nEngineered viruses with controllable dormancy\nCognitive disruption agents designed for non-lethal incapacitation\n\nA particularly concerning element of Benali’s report points to Venus research directives, where scientists were allegedly instructed to analyze atmospheric samples for biomedical applications. A leaked transmission from a senior UN bio researcher references “unexpected regenerative properties”, fuelling speculation that new biological agents may have been developed.\nMartian intelligence agencies have long suspected the UN of classified bioengineering projects, and sources within the Martian Science Directorate claim these allegations, if true, violate interplanetary treaties. Attempts to verify operations at suspected facilities—including Luna’s Black Sky Research Facility and The Heimdall Complex near Saturn—have been met with strict security lockdowns.\nUN officials dismissed the claims as &quot;misinformation designed to stoke fear.&quot; However, critics argue the lack of transparency raises concerns. Benali remains firm:\n&quot;This isn’t about politics. If the UN is developing bioweapons in secret, the public deserves to know—before it’s too late.&quot;\n\nEros Incident: Cover-Up, Conspiracy, or the Beginning of the End?\nBy Dr. Elias Mercer, Asher Foundation Broadcasting\nCERES STATION — The destruction of Eros wasn’t an accident. It was a coordinated event, a power move by Earth and Mars while Belters are left fighting over scraps.

Weber, a known associate of the Voltaire Collective, is suspected of having ties to the radical faction responsible for the attack, which targeted a UN administrative hub. Despite growing evidence of his involvement, Camara has remained defiant, calling the accusations &quot;baseless Inner fearmongering.&quot;\nWhile UN investigators continue to piece together Weber’s movements leading up to the bombing, Camara’s public support has fuelled speculation over just how deep her connections to the Collective run. Corporate sponsors are already distancing themselves from the rising star, but her core Belter fanbase remains fiercely loyal. With authorities tightening their grip on Voltaire sympathizers across the system, many are questioning whether Camara’s association with Weber will tarnish her career—or if the Belt’s biggest star will become an icon of defiance in the face of Inner accusations.\n\nIn other news\nCeres Declares Autonomy Amid UN Withdrawal\nThe Outer Planets Alliance (OPA) has officially declared Ceres Station independent following the withdrawal of UN forces.

		"content": "Ganymede Struggles with Refugee Crisis as Aid Efforts Falter\nBy Halima Okeke, Tycho Free News\nGANYMEDE STATION — The agricultural heart of the outer planets is facing a crisis unlike any in recent history. In the wake of the Eros Incident and rising tensions between the Inners, Ganymede has become a last refuge for thousands of displaced Belters seeking safety, work, and a stable food supply. But the station’s infrastructure, already under strain, is buckling under the weight of the influx, and neither Mars nor Earth seem willing to step up.\nTycho Free News reporters on the ground have spoken with refugees, aid workers, and security forces, all of whom paint a grim picture: overcrowded shelters, dwindling food and medical supplies, and the ever-present risk of conflict between desperate survivors and the military forces meant to keep order.\nA Flood of Desperation\nFollowing the UN’s withdrawal from Ceres and increased instability in the Belt, thousands of Belters—many from asteroid stations now struggling without reliable supply lines—have made their way to Ganymede, hoping to find work or at least a meal. The station’s vast hydroponic farms make it the logical place for displaced Belters to seek refuge, but Ganymede was never designed to accommodate this many new arrivals.\n&quot;The UN left us with nothing,&quot; says Lise Mankuso, a former rockhopper from a decommissioned mining colony near Vesta, now sleeping in a repurposed storage bay. &quot;Ceres is a mess. Tycho’s too far. We thought here, at least, we could find a way to keep living. But we weren’t ready for what we found.&quot;\nTemporary camps have sprung up across the station, but with space at a premium, many refugees are forced to sleep in airlock corridors or converted freight bays. Public services are overwhelmed, and basic necessities like clean water and medical treatment are becoming scarce.\nAid Delays and Bureaucratic Gridlock\nDespite calls from humanitarian organizations and local relief groups, shipments of aid have been slow to arrive. Bureaucratic disputes between Martian authorities, who technically oversee Ganymede’s governance, and independent suppliers from the Belt have left crucial resources stuck in orbit or impounded over security concerns.\n&quot;We have pallets of medical supplies sitting in dock because some MCRN administrator wants another round of clearance forms,&quot; says Darius Kom, a volunteer with the Belt-wide relief group Sa Sa Teik. &quot;Meanwhile, we’ve got kids with lung infections and pregnant women who haven’t had a proper checkup in months.&quot;\nMartian officials maintain that the restrictions are necessary. With tensions high and reports of smuggling networks using refugee movements as cover, security has been tightened around all incoming shipments. An MCRN spokesperson on Ganymede defended the delays, stating,\n&quot;While we sympathize with the situation, we must also ensure that no contraband or dangerous elements enter the station under the guise of humanitarian aid. Our duty is to maintain stability, and that means proper vetting of all incoming supplies and personnel.&quot;\nFor the Belters waiting in overcrowded shelters, such explanations ring hollow.\n&quot;They say we could be smugglers? That we could be trouble? What do they think starvation and disease are?&quot; asks refugee Emmeline Osei, who has been waiting for ration distributions for nearly a week. &quot;They’re more worried about their rules than about whether we live or die.&quot;\nA Powder Keg Waiting to Explode\nWith conditions deteriorating, clashes between refugees and station security forces have become more frequent. In the past two weeks alone, Tycho Free News has confirmed at least four incidents of violence, including protests turning into riots when food shipments failed to arrive as promised.\nOPA-aligned factions operating on the station have been increasingly vocal, accusing Mars of deliberate neglect and warning that if aid doesn’t come soon, Belters will be forced to take what they need.\nAnderson Dawes, a key OPA leader based on Ceres, issued a pointed statement:\n&quot;How many times must we tell them? Belters will not sit quietly while our people starve. If Mars cannot care for Ganymede, then it is time for the Belt to take responsibility for its own. And we will.&quot;\nHis words have only heightened tensions, with rumours spreading that armed OPA groups may be moving toward Ganymede to &quot;secure&quot; supplies for the refugees. If true, it could set the stage for yet another major flashpoint between Belt factions and Martian authorities.\nWho Will Act?\nDespite the worsening conditions, neither Earth nor Mars has made any significant moves to address the crisis. The UN, still grappling with political fallout from Eros and its withdrawal from Ceres, has issued vague assurances that it &quot;remains committed to humanitarian support efforts.&quot; The Martian government, preoccupied with its own military repositioning, appears unwilling to divert resources to a problem it sees as secondary to larger strategic concerns.\nMeanwhile, independent Belter organizations, including relief ships from Tycho Station and Pallas, are attempting to coordinate supply runs. But without official clearance, many of these efforts are being stalled before they can even reach Ganymede’s orbit.\n&quot;It’s always the same,&quot; says Anya Rahm, a former freighter captain now working as a supply coordinator for a Belt relief effort. &quot;Inners fight over who’s in charge, and Belters suffer. If the OPA doesn’t step in soon, the people here won’t have a choice. They’ll fight for what they need, because no one is willing to give it to them.&quot;\nFor now, the thousands of Belters on Ganymede continue to wait—hungry, sick, and increasingly desperate. How much longer until waiting is no longer an option?\n— Tycho Free News will continue to report on the ongoing crisis.

The court determined that ownership of the vessel had not been legally transferred to the Mormon Church at the time, making the dispute a matter of contractual failure rather than criminal wrongdoing.\nWhile the church had argued that Tycho unlawfully seized the ship, justices found that since the official handover had not been completed, Tycho remained the legal owner when the ship was repurposed. As a result, the case has been referred to a lower court to resolve financial claims and contractual obligations rather than issues of theft.\nA Contract Broken, Not a Crime Committed\nThe ruling centers on contractual obligations rather than property rights, meaning that while Tycho may be liable for failing to deliver the vessel as promised, it did not steal the Nauvoo.\nLegal analyst Dr. Nadir Cole of the Luna Academy of Law explained:\n&quot;This ruling doesn’t let Tycho off the hook entirely. The Mormons had a valid agreement, and if Tycho failed to meet its contractual obligations, they could still be ordered to pay damages. But as far as ownership is concerned, the ship was never legally theirs.&quot;\nTycho had maintained throughout the proceedings that the Nauvoo’s redirection was necessary, citing emergency conditions in the Belt that required immediate action. The High Court did not rule on the morality or necessity of that decision, only that the ownership dispute was legally unfounded.\nFinancial Disputes Remain Unresolved\nThe case now moves to a lower commercial court, where legal teams will determine whether Tycho must compensate the Mormon Church for failing to deliver the Nauvoo as agreed. Potential outcomes include:\n\nReimbursement for construction costs, should the court find Tycho breached its contract.\nA settlement, if both parties agree to resolve the matter outside of further litigation.\nPartial damages, depending on whether Tycho can justify its actions under force majeure or emergency provisions.\n\nA spokesperson for the Latter-Day Saints Missionary Fleet expressed frustration with the ruling:\n&quot;The Nauvoo was built for generations of faithful pioneers, not as a tool for political and military interests. We will continue seeking what is rightfully ours.&quot;\nMeanwhile, Tycho executives welcomed the ruling, emphasizing that their actions were dictated by necessity, not profit or malice. The company has yet to comment on whether they will seek a negotiated resolution to the financial claims.\nWhat’s Next for the Nauvoo?\nFor now, the LDSS Nauvoo remains under Tycho control, its future uncertain pending legal resolution. While the Mormons had intended the ship for deep-space colonization, its sheer scale and engineering potential have made it a topic of broader strategic interest.\nWith a lower court set to determine financial liabilities, the final chapter of the Nauvoo dispute is still being written—but one thing is clear: the High Court’s decision has set a precedent for interplanetary contract law, ensuring that future disputes over major projects will be closely scrutinized.\nBHIS will continue to report on developments as the case unfolds.\n\nOther News\nOPA Declares Ceres a “Sovereign Station”\nIn a fiery public address, Anderson Dawes formally declared Ceres Station a “sovereign entity under Belter administration,” rejecting any lingering claims by Earth or Mars. The declaration has been met with cautious silence from the UN and MCRN, while several Belt stations have issued statements of solidarity.\nBelter Pilgrimage Ship Vanishes Near Venus Blockade\nA civilian ship, Baraka’s Wish, believed to be carrying members of the Faith of the Falling Star, disappeared near the Venus exclusion zone. UN officials claim the ship ignored no-entry warnings, while cult sympathizers say the vessel was “called home.”\nHitomi Camara Releases 'Void Lullaby' Amid Scandal\nPop icon Hitomi Camara has released her new single Void Lullaby, dedicated to “those we lost in the silence of Eros.” The song's release comes as controversy brews over her relationship with Django Weber, a suspected member of the Voltaire Collective.\nGunfight Between Rival Gangs Erupts on Ceres Docks\nA violent shoot-out broke out today on Dock 94 between rival criminal gangs, leaving at least eight dead and five injured before Ceres security forces brought the situation under control. Witnesses described a brief but intense exchange of gunfire near the cargo offloading bays, with stray rounds striking nearby freighters and maintenance equipment. Station authorities have launched an investigation into the incident, while Administrator Dawes condemned the violence, vowing that &quot;gang wars will find no safe harbour on Ceres.&quot;",

		"content": "Martian Authorities Concerned as OPA Takes Credit for Ceres Human Trafficking Bust\nBy Renzo Kim, Far Olympus Enterprises\nCERES STATION— A major human trafficking operation on Ceres has been dismantled in a high-profile crackdown led by local security forces under OPA control. While this should be a victory for law and order, the lack of involvement from Martian or UN authorities raises serious concerns about how justice is being administered in the Belt—and whether the OPA is truly cleaning house or merely consolidating power.\nAmong those arrested was Asgard Zo, a former freight hauler with suspected ties to smuggling operations across the Belt. Zo, known for moving illicit cargo, is believed to have played a role in the illegal transport of Belters under false pretences, though reports suggest he may have been coerced into the trade. With his capture, investigators may gain insight into the larger networks funding forced labour operations in the outer planets—assuming OPA-controlled Ceres Security actually follows through.\nOPA’s Tightening Grip on Ceres\nFollowing the bust, Anderson Dawes wasted no time taking credit, publicly declaring:\n&quot;Ceres belongs to Beltalowda, and we will not let parasites prey on our own. The Inners never protected us, so we protect ourselves.&quot;\nWhile the statement plays well among Belters, Martian analysts see it differently—as yet another sign that the OPA is using crime-fighting as a political tool. Dawes’ rapid claim of responsibility suggests this was not just about stopping human trafficking but also about sending a message: Ceres belongs to the OPA now, and neither Mars nor Earth has a say in how it is governed.\nWhere is the Real Justice?\nThe operation liberated dozens of trafficked Belters, many of whom were promised safe passage to Ganymede or Tycho but were instead funnelled into forced labour operations. However, with Ceres Security fully under OPA control, Martian authorities have little oversight over how this case will proceed.\nThe MCRN’s Intelligence Division has been tracking similar human trafficking networks operating in the Belt and has repeatedly called for greater coordination between Martian security forces and OPA-controlled stations. Yet, despite the clear criminal connections that extend beyond the Belt, OPA leadership continues to act unilaterally, rejecting any external intervention.\n&quot;If the OPA is truly committed to fighting crime, they should be willing to cooperate with legitimate law enforcement agencies,&quot; stated Commander Felix Moran, a spokesperson for the MCRN’s Outer Planets Enforcement Taskforce. &quot;Instead, they seize opportunities like this to legitimize their rule while shutting out any real accountability.&quot;\nWhat Comes Next?\nWhile the operation was successful, the real question is what happens next. Will Asgard Zo and other detainees face a proper trial, or will justice be handled in the shadows? Will this truly mark the beginning of a Belt-wide effort against human trafficking, or is it simply a selective crackdown meant to eliminate rival criminal factions while keeping OPA-friendly operations intact?\nWith Mars maintaining patrols in the outer system, officials will be watching closely to see if this bust leads to genuine reform or if Ceres is simply trading one kind of lawlessness for another. Until the OPA proves it can administer justice fairly—and without using it as a political weapon—Martian authorities will remain deeply sceptical of Dawes’ self-proclaimed victory.\n\nKT Endeavour Disaster: Another Eros Cover-Up?\nBy Jordan Kaine, Pyramid News Network (PNN)\nCALLISTO— The Kruger-Thompson cargo freighter KT Endeavour is gone, its crew dead, and the official explanation? A &quot;mechanical failure.&quot; Sound familiar? Because it should. This has all the markings of another Eros-style cover-up, and we at PNN aren’t buying the corporate lies.\nLet’s talk facts. A ship doesn’t just lose atmosphere instantly unless something catastrophic happens. But here’s where it gets interesting—sources claim that the MCRN was monitoring the region before the disaster, and Kruger-Thompson has moved quickly to shut down outside investigations.\nConnections to Eros and the Venus Silence\nIt’s been months since Eros slammed into Venus, and yet we’re still locked out of real data on what’s happening there. UN scientists aren’t talking, transmissions aren’t being shared, and now we have a supply freighter mysteriously destroyed? Coincidence? Or is someone making sure the wrong people don’t start asking the right questions?\nHere’s what the Inners want you to ignore:\n\nThe Endeavour was operating near key trade routes connected to the Venus blockade.\nSources suggest it was carrying classified cargo—something Kruger-Thompson does not want the public to know about.\nThe same corporate forces that covered up Eros are now locking down the Endeavour's wreckage, keeping independent investigators out.\n\nWhat Were They Hiding?\nSpeculation is running wild, and for good reason. Was the Endeavour transporting materials linked to whatever’s happening on Venus? Did the UNN or MCRN take it out to prevent leaks? Or worse—did the crew of the Endeavour see something they weren’t supposed to?\nA Martian deep-space patrol was spotted in the area suspiciously fast, and Kruger-Thompson executives have been conveniently unavailable for comment. One high-level insider even suggested that this &quot;accident&quot; was meant to erase evidence of a secret supply operation—possibly related to scientific research on Venus itself.\nIf you think this sounds crazy, ask yourself this: Why are the same people who lied about Eros the ones telling you to ignore the Endeavour?\nThis isn’t just another corporate disaster. Something bigger is happening. And if history has taught us anything, it’s that the truth will only come out if we demand it.\n\nOther News\nEarth-Based Charity Accused of Trafficking Medical Supplies\nHopeBridge International, a Basic-funded NGO, has been accused of rerouting donated medical supplies to corporate buyers instead of Belt clinics. An internal UN audit is underway, though critics argue enforcement in Luna-based operations remains lax.\nOPA Patrol Breaks Ossifex Black Market Ring on Ceres\nA major bust led by Dawes-aligned security forces uncovered a criminal ring diluting Ossifex prescriptions and selling the real doses on the black market. The scheme, allegedly run by Earther Dr. Donald Hanlon, has been tied to multiple Belter deaths.\nMartian Colonial Assembly Debates Independence from Earth Trade Pacts\nThe Red Bloc, a political faction within Mars’ Colonial Assembly, has introduced a motion to suspend mutual trade protocols with Earth, citing “chronic exploitation and imbalance.” Though unlikely to pass, the motion reflects growing Martian assertiveness post-Eros.\nCeres Security Arrests Alleged Voltaire Collective Sleeper Cell\nThree individuals arrested in Mendel District are suspected of planning infrastructure sabotage on behalf of the Voltaire Collective. While details remain scarce, the arrests have sparked fear of further Inner-targeted violence within OPA-controlled space.",

		"content": "Faith of the Falling Star: A Cult Exploiting the Mystery of Venus?\nBy the Interplanetary Journalism Guild\nLUNA— As the scientific community remains silent about the fate of Venus after the Eros Incident, a new religious movement has begun to spread across the system. Calling themselves &quot;The Faith of the Falling Star,&quot; its followers believe that Eros' descent was a divine event and that Venus is now the site of a coming revelation that will reshape humanity.\nHowever, an Interplanetary Journalism Guild (IJG) investigation has uncovered disturbing evidence that the Faith’s leaders may be less interested in prophecy and more in profit—exploiting desperate followers while spreading misinformation to grow their influence and wealth.\nA Cult Fuelled by Fear and Secrecy\nThe Faith of the Falling Star has gained traction on Luna, Mars, and Belt stations, attracting people who feel abandoned by their governments in the wake of Eros. Its doctrine is based entirely on speculation—without a shred of scientific evidence—but that has done little to deter followers.\nThe Faith teaches that:\n\nEros was the beginning of a new cosmic order.\nVenus is now a sacred world, preparing for the “Great Awakening.”\nOnly the faithful will be able to “hear the call” when the revelation comes.\nInners and corporations are suppressing the truth to prevent humanity’s ascension.\n\nOne of the movement’s leading figures, Reverend Kellan Jow, has been vocal in claiming that Venus itself is sending messages—despite there being no surviving witnesses from Eros to substantiate any claims.\n&quot;They lied about Eros. They are lying about Venus. But the Falling Star speaks to those who listen,&quot; Jow said during a sermon broadcast from an undisclosed location.\nWhere Is the Money Going?\nWhile the Faith presents itself as a spiritual movement, IJG investigators have found serious financial irregularities within its ranks.\nFollowers are encouraged to:\n\nDonate to “pilgrimage funds” that have no recorded transactions or intended destination.\nPurchase exclusive access to &quot;sacred teachings,&quot; which consist of vague, recycled conspiracy theories.\nPay for &quot;purification rituals,&quot; often in the form of expensive supplements and unproven oxygen therapies.\n\nOne former member, who spoke anonymously for fear of retaliation, revealed that Faith leaders pressure followers into handing over their savings for a &quot;journey to enlightenment&quot;—a journey that never actually happens.\n&quot;I gave them everything,&quot; the ex-follower told IJG. &quot;They said I was chosen, that I would be the first to witness the truth. But when I started asking questions, they told me I wasn’t ‘ready.’ Now I have nothing.&quot;\nPilgrimage to Venus: A Death Sentence?\nPerhaps the most alarming aspect of the Faith’s practices is the encouragement of pilgrimages to Venus—a suicidal mission given the complete lack of information about the planet’s conditions.\nWhile no recorded attempts have been made, leaked communications suggest that some followers have been gathering resources to fund a deep-space vessel—one they believe will bring them to Venus when the &quot;time is right.&quot;\nThe Silence That Feeds the Fire\nThe lack of official information about Venus has only fueled the Faith’s claims, with followers insisting that secrecy proves that the truth is being hidden. While scientific institutions and governments maintain that Venus is still under study, their silence is allowing cult leaders to control the narrative.\nDr. Harlan Voight, a sociologist specializing in religious extremism, warns that this is exactly how destructive cults gain power.\n&quot;The less people know, the more they are willing to believe. If no official explanation is given, the vacuum will be filled by those who can exploit fear and faith for their own benefit,&quot; Voight said.\nWhat Comes Next?\nWith reports of growing recruitment efforts and continued financial exploitation, the Faith of the Falling Star is becoming more than just a fringe movement. If leaders begin directing followers toward drastic actions, the consequences could be catastrophic.\nWhile the system waits for answers about Venus, one thing is clear: this cult is not about enlightenment—it’s about control.\n\nDjango Weber: A Terrorist Shielded by the Belt, Embarrassing Earth on the Interplanetary Stage\nBy Anthony Graves, Pope Enterprises Media Division\nThe Voltaire Collective bombing on Luna was not just an act of terrorism—it was an attack on Earth’s authority and a glaring example of the unchecked radicalism festering in the Belt. Django Weber, one of the masterminds behind this atrocity, is still free, flaunting his celebrity connections and OPA sympathies, while the UNN hesitates to bring him to justice.\nAnd in that hesitation, Earth looks weak. Mars is watching.\nThe Belt Hides Criminals While Earth Plays Diplomat\nWeber, a known radical with ties to anti-Earth extremists, should be in a UNN detention cell right now. Instead, he is hiding in plain sight, shielded by his popstar girlfriend, Hitomi Camara, who—surprise, surprise—has made a career glorifying Belt resistance and stoking anti-Earth sentiment.\nThe Belt has always protected its worst elements. It’s what people like Fred Johnson built their careers on—pretending to be legitimate while running a lawless, pirate-infested backwater. And now, Johnson, the so-called &quot;reasonable OPA leader,&quot; remains silent on Weber.\nAsk yourself: If the OPA truly stood against terrorism, wouldn’t Johnson be handing Weber over to the UNN right now? Instead, they are stalling, hiding behind bureaucracy, while a known terrorist walks free.\nThe truth is clear: The Belt does not respect Earth’s authority, because it does not fear Earth’s power.\nMars Is Watching, and Earth Looks Weak\nWhile the UNN hesitates, Mars is taking notes. The MCRN, already reasserting its dominance in the Belt, now sees an Earth that can’t even bring in a single terrorist who bombed a station on Luna—a station that Earth controls.\nWhat message does that send?\n\nThat Earth will tolerate open acts of terrorism as long as the Belt throws up enough political smoke.\nThat Fred Johnson and his OPA “government” can harbor criminals without consequence.\nThat the UNN lacks the will to enforce law beyond the gravity well of Earth.\n\nAnd that weakness is exactly what Mars has been waiting for. With tensions already high, the MCRN has been pushing harder, expanding its fleet presence near key Belt stations. The moment Earth looks distracted, Mars will move to capitalize.\nThis is not just about Weber. This is about credibility.\nThe Solution Is Clear—Eliminate the Threat, Reassert Earth’s Power\nThe UNN needs to stop treating the Belt like a nation-state and start treating it like what it is—an unruly colony that has mistaken patience for weakness.\nDjango Weber must be hunted down and captured—immediately. If the Belt refuses to cooperate, Earth must remind them who controls the lanes, the air, and the lifelines that keep their little stations running.\nAnd if Fred Johnson wants to play politics instead of handing over a terrorist, perhaps it’s time Earth stops recognizing his authority altogether.\nBecause if the UNN continues to drag its feet, Mars will see its opportunity. And when that happens, Weber will be the least of Earth’s problems.\nPope Enterprises Media Division will continue to advocate for a strong, decisive Earth—because anything less invites war.\n\nOther News\nMartian Mining Guild Begins Expansion into Io\nThe MCRN-backed Martian Mining Guild has begun preliminary operations on Io, promising economic revitalization and increased material supply for military infrastructure. Belter labour unions have protested the move, claiming exclusion from contracts and risk to native tunnel colonies.\nFaith of the Falling Star Opens Temple on Ganymede\nDespite mounting scrutiny, the Faith of the Falling Star has established its first formal “Temple of Ascension” on Ganymede.

		"content": "BREAKING: Cult Fleet Challenges Venus Quarantine in Defiant Pilgrimage\nBy Leyra Cho, Luna Freewave Correspondent\nORBITAL SPACE — In a dramatic and unprecedented act of defiance, an unknown number of vessels affiliated with the religious movement known as the Faith of the Falling Star have reportedly attempted to breach the United Nations Navy quarantine zone surrounding Venus.\nEyewitness reports and leaked UNN tactical alerts suggest that the vessels, described as a &quot;loose formation of retrofitted civilian craft,&quot; emerged from multiple vectors at varying speeds before accelerating toward the exclusion zone established after the Eros Incident.\nThe total number of ships remains unconfirmed, with initial estimates ranging from seven to possibly over two dozen. No official list of registries or trajectories has been released. Several of the ships were described as small freighters and industrial haulers, likely modified for deep space endurance.\n“The Cradle Is Opening”\nShortly before the attempted breach, a garbled but deliberate broadcast was received across multiple civilian channels in the Belt and Martian space:\n\n“We spiral now to the Cradle Below. The silence ends. The Taken return. Do not mourn us. We go to be remade.”\n\nThe transmission was signed with the symbol of the Faith of the Falling Star—a spiral waveform descending into a black circle.\nUNN Engagement Unconfirmed\nThe United Nations Navy has not issued a formal statement, but comms silence across key listening posts in the inner system has fuelled speculation that engagements may have occurred. The Venus Quarantine Command, headquartered on a secure lunar relay, temporarily entered blackout protocol.\nA single anonymous UNN source, speaking off record, described the event as “a coordinated mass incursion attempt” and confirmed that several ships were intercepted, though would not comment on whether any reached Venusian descent.\nMixed Reactions Across the System\nOn Ceres, impromptu vigils lit up corridors in Sector 12 and Meidani Ring, with mourners painting spirals and chanting the Five Verses of the Canticle. On Mars, government spokespeople have warned against “fringe religious extremism masquerading as spiritual enlightenment.”\nDr. Harlan Voight, sociologist and cult researcher, stated:\n\n“This is what happens when spiritual desperation meets systemic silence. If even one ship got through, the mythology of the Faith just became unbreakable.”\n\nA Growing Legend\nWhether any of the ships reached Venus is currently unknown. Debris signatures detected by Martian long-range arrays suggest that some vessels may have been destroyed, but those readings remain unconfirmed and lack independent verification.\nAs the system watches and wonders, the Faith’s mantra spreads once again across dark corridors and encrypted channels:\n“The Taken shall return.”\n\nHavoc “The Gambler” Suro: The Man Who Called the System’s Bluff — and Won\nSir Gary Fitzwilliam\nEvery generation, the Belt gives us a name. Not a politician. Not a soldier. A name. A force of nature. A living myth. This cycle, that name is Havoc Suro.\n“The Gambler,” they call him — and with good reason. Because when others hedge their bets or fold under pressure, Havoc pushes all his chips to the center of the table and dares the universe to blink.\nAnd this time? He didn’t just win. He saved lives.\nCeres Station has seen its share of cruelty, but the Ossifex ring was a new kind of rot — hidden behind a clinic door and a counterfeit smile. Belters, already brittle from low gravity and hard living, were seeking bone-density meds to stay functional. What they got instead was a cocktail of expired pharmaceuticals, some decades past safety, swapped in by a corrupt doctor lining his pockets by selling the real Ossifex on the black market.\nIt was quiet. It was cowardly. And it would’ve gone on forever — if Havoc hadn’t shown up.\nNo badge. No funding. No backup.\nJust instinct, fire, and that voice — low, dangerous, and rough like Ceres stone. While Star Helix turned away and officials shrugged, Havoc followed the trail through the underbelly of the docks, through lies, locked doors, and rigged games. He stared down thugs, dodged bribes, and cracked the whole scheme open with the kind of righteous fury that makes old Belters weep.\nAnd when he kicked that door in and dragged the truth out — we all felt it. Like air returning to a leaky compartment. Like someone giving a damn.\nThey say he used to run with the old-school OPA — the kind that didn’t posture, just acted. That’s not surprising. Because what Havoc did wasn’t policing. It wasn’t politics. It was protection. Of the Belt. Of its people. Of our pride.\nToday, the fake meds are gone. The black-market Ossifex trade is broken. The clinic's dark deal is exposed. And Ceres? Ceres remembers who did it.\nHe’s not a cop. He’s not a politician. He’s Havoc. And he gambled everything — his safety, his future, his name — on the lives of strangers. And the Belt won.\nSo say it loud, say it proud, say it with a raised cup and a clenched fist:\nHavoc &quot;The Gambler&quot; walks among us. And the bastards are running scared.\n\nTensions Erupt on Saint-Germain Station as Criminal Rivalry Boils Over\n*By Juno Salcedo, Senior Correspondent – Luna Daily Ledger\n21 LUTETIA— Violence has shattered the fragile calm of Saint-Germain Station, a UN-chartered refuelling outpost nestled on the surface of the asteroid 21 Lutetia, after an intense outbreak of conflict between two criminal factions. The once-covert rivalry between the notorious Loca Griega gang and the ambitious Golden Bough Society has now erupted into open hostilities, putting station operations and civilian safety at risk.\nWitnesses report a dramatic escalation earlier this week when the Golden Bough moved aggressively to assert control over the station’s black market supply networks. Previously, the station’s ‘security’ had been nominally maintained by the Loca Griega, whose influence ensured a steady but discreet siphoning of goods — a practice that Saint-Germain’s primary client, Saturnalia Cruises, has long turned a blind eye to as a “cost of doing business.”\nThat uneasy arrangement, however, now lies in ruins.\nA Battle in the Black\nThe conflict reached its climax when a skirmish near the station’s primary landing platform saw the Loca Griega’s frigate, Maraguena, left wrecked and crippled after a brutal exchange with the Golden Bough gunship Yojimbo. Debris from the stricken vessel remains scattered along the asteroid’s pocked surface, a grim reminder of the swift and decisive escalation.\n&quot;We saw the flashes from the station windows,&quot; one dock tech recounted. &quot;The Maraguena didn’t stand a chance. Then we heard the emergency klaxons. That’s when we knew something bad was going down.&quot;\nStation sensors logged multiple weapons discharges in the hours that followed, though security reports remain restricted. While the full extent of casualties is unconfirmed, rumours suggest the Golden Bough’s enforcers have begun a systematic sweep of former Loca Griega strongholds on the station.\nAdministrator Silvanito Under Pressure\nSaint-Germain’s Station Administrator, Silvanito, is now facing mounting scrutiny for allowing criminal elements to flourish unchecked. Though technically under UN oversight, the outpost has gained a reputation for laissez-faire governance, with station security often looking the other way in exchange for a share of illicit profits.\nSilvanito, known for his preference for maintaining “business as usual,” has so far issued only a brief statement:\n&quot;Saint-Germain Station remains operational, and we are cooperating with UN authorities to ensure safety and stability. Recent incidents are regrettable, but pose no ongoing threat to station personnel or commercial activity.&quot;\nCritics, however, argue that Silvanito’s passivity has emboldened the Golden Bough and made Saint-Germain a battleground.\nSaturnalia Cruises Maintains Silence\nAs one of Saint-Germain’s main corporate beneficiaries, Saturnalia Cruises has yet to comment on the situation. The Luna-based luxury operator, known for ferrying Earth’s ultra-wealthy to Titan’s exclusive holiday domes, has long relied on the station as a critical refuelling and resupply hub. Insiders suggest the company was fully aware of Loca Griega’s influence but chose to tolerate the arrangement to avoid disruptions to its lucrative routes.\n&quot;It’s all about appearances,&quot; said a senior dock foreman. &quot;So long as the champagne flows on Titan, no one cares what happens in the cargo hold.&quot;\nHowever, with the Golden Bough’s violent methods now dominating the station, pressure is mounting on Saturnalia’s leadership to intervene — or risk further destabilization of its most vital supply chain.\nUncertain Future\nFor now, Saint-Germain remains under the shadow of Golden Bough control, with patrols reported throughout the lower decks. UN oversight remains nominal, with local authorities reluctant to provoke further violence. Whether this conflict will settle into a stable — if brutal — status quo, or escalate further, remains to be seen.\nThe people of Saint-Germain, many of whom rely on the station for work and survival, can do little but wait — and hope the dust settles soon.\n\nOther News\nUNN Tightens Patrol Routes Near Venus\nWithout explanation, the United Nations Navy has rerouted several naval patrols to maintain a tighter perimeter around Venus, citing &quot;ongoing classified investigations.&quot; This move has sparked speculation that the UN is still unsure what transpired after Eros’ impact—and what might still be unfolding in the clouds.\nMCRN Vessel Intercepts Unauthorized Tycho Freighter\nMartian Naval Command reports that a Tycho-based freighter was intercepted near Phobos, allegedly carrying unauthorized surveillance equipment. The crew has been detained pending diplomatic arbitration, escalating tensions between Tycho and Mars.\nUnscheduled Work Stoppage Reported at Mathilde Station\nSources inside Kruger-Thompson's Mathilde Station have reported a sudden halt to ore processing operations this week. The company cited “routine maintenance and personnel reallocation” in a terse update issued to shareholders, though some supply partners have noted delayed shipments. Belter labour representatives have raised questions about the shutdown but have so far been denied access to the site.\nOPA Leadership Fractures Over Use of Force\nTensions have surfaced between factions of the OPA, with some accusing Fred Johnson of being too conciliatory toward Earth, while others decry Dawes for escalating security measures on Ceres. An emergency council session is scheduled to address leadership structure and strategic direction.",

		"content": "You see, the Eros Incident is not merely a historical event; it is a biblical event in its essence. It is an unveiling of the fallen nature of man—the hubris, the sin, and the inevitable suffering that follows when we abandon the Logos, the divine order, in favour of our own twisted ambitions. This is Cain slaying Abel on a planetary scale. This is the Tower of Babel, not just reaching to the heavens, but penetrating into the unknown depths of creation where man was never meant to tread.\nWhat happened on Eros was sacrificial—but not in the way that Christ was sacrificed for the redemption of mankind. This was the inversion of sacrifice. Instead of offering oneself in obedience to truth, the powerful offered the weak in obedience to ambition. This is the core of tyranny, the corruption that seeps into human institutions when they believe they can create meaning and define morality, rather than submit to the moral structure already present in the fabric of the universe.\nAnd we must ask: why did this happen? Why did Protogen, a corporation run by men and women like you and me—educated, strategic, ambitious—why did they choose to commit such a crime? It wasn’t mere greed. No, no, it was something much deeper.\nIt was the same temptation that lurked in the Garden. It was the Serpent’s whisper: You shall be as gods.\nThat’s the lie that has seduced humanity since the beginning. The idea that we can redefine the cosmos on our terms, that we can transcend our limitations, that we can master forces beyond our understanding. And what did it lead to? The creation of a new god—a terrible, mindless god, consuming and reshaping everything in its image. This is the birth of an abomination, a golden calf made not of metal, but of suffering, flesh, and alien horror.\nAnd this is what people don’t understand about the moral structure of reality. We like to think we can dabble in the unknown, that we can grasp knowledge and own it, like it’s a commodity. But the Bible tells us something very different. It tells us that knowledge is dangerous. That without wisdom, without morality, knowledge doesn’t free you—it enslaves you. That’s what the Fall was about! Adam and Eve took the fruit, not because they were starving, not because they were in need, but because they wanted to know, they wanted to decide for themselves what was right and wrong.\nProtogen did the exact same thing. They found something beyond human comprehension, and instead of approaching it with humility, instead of treating it as sacred, they decided to use it. To own it. To control it.\nAnd look what happened.\nA plague upon a people who had no say in their own fate. The Belters were sacrificed to this new god of science without morality. But that’s always how these things go. The powerful never offer themselves. They don’t take up the Cross. They make others carry it for them. And that, my friends, is not just evil—it is satanic.\nNow, consider what followed. Eros moved. Eros thought. It was no longer just a station; it became something else. And this is where we enter truly biblical territory. Because Eros, as it fell into the grip of the protomolecule, became a city of the damned.\nThink of the story of Sodom and Gomorrah. A city so steeped in sin, in corruption, that it had to be destroyed—not just because the people were wicked, but because the city itself had become an abomination. The Eros Incident is the same story, told again, in the language of science fiction. The entire station became possessed, if you will, by an alien force that twisted everything it touched. And once it started moving toward Earth, it was no longer just a tragedy—it was an apocalypse.\nAnd that’s the warning here. That’s the moral of this catastrophe.\nWe think we are the masters of creation. We think we are the builders of Babel, the rulers of our own destiny. But the moment we sever our knowledge from divine wisdom, the moment we try to wrestle control of the universe away from God, we don’t gain power. We unleash it. And once it is unleashed, it does not serve us—it devours us.\nEros was a lesson. It was a demonstration of what happens when humanity plays at divinity. And what was the result? The whole world stood at the edge of annihilation, because a handful of people thought they could reach beyond what was rightfully theirs.\nSo what do we learn from this?\nFirst, that suffering is the inevitable result of knowledge without wisdom. That is why scripture constantly warns us about arrogance. ‘Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.’ And what is Eros but the fall? A world plunged into chaos because of the pride of a few.\nSecond, we learn that power is never neutral. You cannot separate knowledge from morality. The idea that science is ‘just science,’ that progress is always good—this is an illusion. The world doesn’t work that way. The only thing that prevents every scientific breakthrough from turning into another Eros is moral restraint.\nAnd third, and perhaps most importantly, we learn that there are forces in this universe beyond our comprehension, and we would be wise to fear them. Whether you call it the protomolecule, the abyss, or something else, the lesson is the same: Some doors are not meant to be opened.\nSo what do we do?\nWe repent. We recognize our limitations. We do not abandon knowledge, but we subordinate it to something higher. The way forward is not the reckless pursuit of power. The way forward is the Logos, the divine order, the wisdom that comes from humility before God.\nBecause if we don’t learn this lesson—if we keep pretending that we are gods—then we will see another Eros.\nAnd next time, we might not survive it.&quot;\n&quot;Sort yourselves out, before it’s too late.&quot;",

		"content": "&quot;Okay, folks, we’re talking about Eros. Terrible thing. Just terrible. A total disaster. Maybe one of the worst disasters in human history. And let me tell you, nobody saw this coming—well, except me. I would have seen it coming.\nBecause here’s the thing—what happened on Eros? It should never have happened. Never. But you had these weak, weak leaders. Weak politicians, weak scientists, and—most importantly—weak corporations, and they let this horrible thing happen. And now, look at it—Eros, a total mess. It’s floating around, glowing blue, making everybody very, very nervous. And frankly, it’s not good. It’s very bad.\nNow, I’m a businessman, okay? I know deals. I’ve made incredible deals. And let me tell you something—Protogen? Bad deal. Very bad deal. What they did—unbelievable. They take this alien goo, right? This, uh, what do they call it? The proto—whatever. And they decide, ‘Hey, let’s just dump it on a bunch of Belters, see what happens.’ Disgusting! Disgusting! And now, all these people are—let’s be honest—melted. They’re blue and glowing and floating around, and it’s not good.\nAnd where was the UN? Where was Mars? Nowhere! Nowhere to be found. They were sitting around, making bad decisions, probably giving out more free healthcare or something—very sad. Meanwhile, Eros is getting taken over by this thing, and suddenly, it’s moving. Can you believe that? Moving. They said, ‘Oh, it can’t move,’ and then—boom!—it moves! That’s the kind of thing we should’ve stopped before it happened. But no one listened to the smart people—like me.\nNow, let me tell you what I would have done. First of all, folks, let’s be real—we would have had the best space security. Absolutely the best. I would’ve built an incredible defence system. A tremendous defence system. Some people are saying—many people are saying—it would have been the greatest defence system.\nAnd you know what? We wouldn’t have let this happen. We would’ve been tough. We would’ve been smart. We would’ve said, ‘Hey, Protogen, you wanna play games with alien goo? Not happening. Not on my watch.’ We’d hit ‘em with sanctions—big sanctions. I do the best sanctions, believe me. And if they didn’t stop? Boom! We shut them down. Totally shut them down.\nAnd another thing—I like Belters, okay? Some Belters, great people. Hardworking people. But let’s be honest, folks, the Belt has a lot of problems. A lot of problems. Crime, corruption—terrible. And what did the UN do? Nothing. They let this happen. Meanwhile, we’ve got people out there, good people, hard-working people, trying to make an honest living—and suddenly, their space station is crawling with blue glowy zombies. Not good! Not good at all.\nNow, let me tell you what we should be doing. First, we get tough on corporations that do very bad things—like Protogen. We hold them accountable. We win. Second, we protect our people—Inner, Outer, doesn’t matter. If you’re human, we protect you. And third? We make sure this never happens again. We put up a big, beautiful defence system around Medina Station, around Ceres. A huge shield. And I know shields, folks. I do great shields. We stop alien goo before it spreads.\nAnd let me say this, because it’s very important—people are asking, ‘Mr. Trump, do you think this was an invasion? Do you think the aliens are coming?’ And let me tell you, I don’t know. Some people are saying it was. Many people. But let’s just say, if the aliens are coming? They’re gonna find out real fast that we don’t mess around. Not with me in charge.\nSo let’s fix this. Let’s be smart. Let’s be tough. And let’s make sure Eros never happens again.\nAnd by the way, folks, if you see any blue glowy people floating around? Run. It’s bad. Very bad. Okay?\nThank you, everybody. You’re amazing people. Love you all. God bless.&quot;\nHe steps back from the podium, flashes a thumbs-up, and walks off as the crowd erupts into cheers.",

		"content": "Origins\nFormed in the waning years of the 21st century, the Church of Humanity Ascendant emerged in response to growing disillusionment with traditional religion, rising automation, and rapid genetic and cybernetic progress. It was seeded among bioethicists, spacers, and secular philosophers who saw human potential as the only worthy object of reverence. With Earth’s faiths still dominant, the Church began as a fringe ideology, but found footholds among off-worlders looking for meaning beyond dogma.\nCore Beliefs\n\nHumanity is improvable: Through science, empathy, and discipline.\nThe divine is a myth: There are no gods, only people—and people can change.\nEvery life has the capacity to transcend its limits.\nAltruism is the highest calling: To elevate others is to rise yourself.\nEthical augmentation is sacred labour: Cybernetics and genetics are tools of uplift, not corruption.\n\nCore Doctrines\n\nSecular Ascension: The path to transcendence lies in biology, mind, and community, not mysticism.\nReject Superstition: All supernatural explanations are to be questioned and discarded.\nThe Flesh is Malleable: The body is a vessel to be shaped toward higher function and form.\nThe Mind Must Inquire: Doctrine must evolve with evidence; belief is never fixed.\nService Equals Salvation: Charity is not a virtue—it is the proof of alignment with the Church's path.\n\nPractices &amp; Symbols\n\nOrange Robes: Loose, flame-toned robes identify missionaries and monks. They signal humility and growth.\nPublic Augmentations: Church-affiliated clinics perform bio-enhancements as rites of passage—sometimes symbolically minor, sometimes profound.\nAscension Gatherings: Group discussions and debates, often held in station squares or low-G temples.\nEthical Records: Members maintain personal journals tracking acts of service and self-betterment as moral logs.\nIconography: The ascending helix—a stylized double helix coiling into an upward spiral—marks their literature and robes.\n\nSpread &amp; Structure\n\nPrimary Locations:\n\nEarth: Scattered in urban zones, often aiding the Basic population.\nGanymede: Runs underground medical centres and food programs.\nCeres: Low-key missionary presence focused on education and medical access.\nTycho &amp; Luna: Quiet philosophical circles and biotech clinics.\n\nStructure: Decentralized. Monks and missionaries act autonomously but often share resources through encrypted networks. Elders gather for regional coordination only during crisis or reform.\nFunding: Donations, technical work-for-hire, and gene therapy services offered to Belters, often free or pay-what-you-can.\n\nDoctrine Tenets\n\nHumans Can Improve—So We Must.\nReject the Supernatural, Embrace the Possible.\nCharity and Education Are Sacred Duties.\nEnhance the Body, Elevate the Mind, Enlighten the Culture.\nQuestion, Evolve, Repeat.\n\nControversies &amp; Reactions\n\nGroup\nReaction\n\nTraditional Faiths\nSee them as arrogant or tragic—sincere but mistaken. Sometimes ally on humanitarian grounds.\n\nEarth Governments\nMildly suspicious due to their criticism of state inaction, especially around Basic conditions.\n\nBelters\nMixed. Welcomed when they provide real aid; mistrusted if they’re seen as Earther moralists.\n\nMartian Society\nTolerated in academic circles. Martian military doctrine sees them as naive.\n\nScientific Establishment\nDivided. Some see them as valuable social ethicists; others accuse them of soft propaganda.\n\nNotable Conflicts\n\nQuietly banned from some UN medical facilities after “unauthorized” augment surgeries on Basic youth.\nHarassed by Golden Bough and other gangs on Ganymede for cutting into narcotics revenue through rehab initiatives.\nKnown to publicly debate OPA agitators on whether violence can ever be part of human moral evolution.",

		"content": "Origin\nThe Faith of the Falling Star emerged in the raw aftermath of the Eros Incident—when the station, once a symbol of Belt neglect, became the centre of something impossible. As Eros altered course and hurled itself toward Venus, a group of Belter technicians monitoring emergency frequencies cracked into an internal audio feed from deep within the station. What they heard was indescribable: screams that folded into hymns, static that carried layered voices, and something else—patterns that felt intentional. They broadcast the feed, pirate-radio style, across the system. Most dismissed it as noise. Others heard meaning.\nThis audio, now called the “Eros Canticle,” became the first scripture of the Faith.\nCore Beliefs\nThe Star Sang\nEros was not silent in its transformation. The sounds within were not chaos—they were revelation.\nThe pirate broadcast was no accident; it was a divine calling made audible.\nVenus is the Cradle Below\nWhere Eros vanished is sacred.\nIt is the womb of metamorphosis, where those taken are remade beyond flesh and time.\nThe Taken Still Speak\nThose lost aboard Eros did not perish. They were ascended.\nTheir cries, their memories, are carried within the Eros Canticle and the whispers that follow.\nThe Signal Continues\nThough the original transmission has ended, many followers report fragments—static with rhythm, half-speech in dreams, and subtle messages embedded in comms lag.\nThe faithful call this Echo.\nCore Doctrine - The Five Spirals\n\nSpiral\nTitle\nCentral Event\nBelief &amp; Meaning\n\nFirst Spiral\nThe Fall\nEros moves of its own accord toward Venus\nThe moment of divine awakening. Eros’s impossible motion marks the beginning of revelation and proves a higher will at work.\n\nSecond Spiral\nThe Voice\nThe hacked Eros transmission is broadcast\nThe Eros Canticle becomes sacred scripture. The Voice is divine—fragmented, layered, and personal. All who hear it are changed.\n\nThird Spiral\nThe Taken\nThe absorption of Eros’ inhabitants into the unknown\nThose lost are not dead—they are transformed. The Taken wait in the Cradle Below, to one day return.\n\nFourth Spiral\nThe Silence\nThe sudden end of the transmission\nSilence is not absence—it is preparation. In stillness, the faithful learn to listen for the next verse.\n\nFifth Spiral\nThe Return\n(Prophesied) The Taken will emerge from the Cradle\nA time will come when the Cradle opens. The Taken will guide the faithful to transcendence and spiral anew.\n\nPractices &amp; Symbols\nThe Eros Canticle\nPlayed at low volume during rites and meditation, it is treated as holy scripture.\nMany claim to hear different words each time—a personal message.\nResonance Rituals\nRitual deprivation, harmonic chanting, and dream-exploration are used to sync with the Canticle and open oneself to new “verses.”\nCanticle Tattoos\nWaveform lines from key moments in the broadcast are tattooed on skin—usually behind the ears, along the forearms, or over the spine.\n\nSymbol\nA star following a spiral path of audio waves to a circle at the centre. A simplified version appears as a sigil carved into ship hulls or etched into data cores.\n\nSpread &amp; Structure\n\nBelter Roots: The origin is unambiguously Belter. The original hack was performed by a loose crew of emergency techs from Pallas and Ceres. Most became early Witnesses or martyrs.\nMartian Cells: Martian youth, radicalized by the suppression of the broadcast, formed secret study groups decoding and reinterpreting the Canticle. These groups blended Martian stoicism with ecstatic mysticism.\nEarther Echoes: In Basic tenements and flooded data markets, Earther cells emerged through black-market recordings. On Earth, the cult blends despair and longing into faith.\nDecentralized Faith: Each Flock follows its own Witness—someone who has heard the Canticle not just with ears, but soul. There is no Pope, no high priest—only those who have been touched.\n\nDoctrine Tenets\n\nThe Fall Was the First Verse. Descent is not death—it is transformation.\nThe Voice Was Given to All. The broadcast was the divine speaking, and all who heard were chosen.\nThe Canticle Continues. Echoes may come in static, in dreams, in madness. Listen.\nThe Cradle Will Break Open. One day, Venus will birth the next phase of existence—and the Taken shall return.\nThe Song Must Be Shared. Every recording, every re-broadcast, every whispered echo is an act of worship.\n\nControversies &amp; Reactions\nUN\n\nUN Censorship: The original transmission was flagged and erased from official networks. Possession of a full copy on Earth can result in imprisonment.\n\nMCRN\n\nMCRN Crackdown: On Mars, those caught distributing fragments of the Canticle are tried under sedition charges. Yet the waveform circulates in encrypted code.\n\nOPA\n\nOPA Debate: Some OPA hardliners see the Faith as superstition. Others, particularly those who helped hack the original broadcast, see it as proof of the Belt's spiritual primacy.\n\nGeneral\n\nSolar Reaction: Most authorities label the Faith as a cult of trauma and delusion. But the Faith doesn't seek approval. It only seeks resonance.",

		"content": "Origins\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often called the Mormons, traces its origins to early 19th-century America, where it emerged as a restorationist movement under Joseph Smith. By the 24th century, the Church remains one of Earth's most enduring religious institutions. It maintains cultural cohesion through its deeply rooted values of community, mission, and self-reliance. In The Expanse, the LDS Church remains headquartered on Earth but has extended its presence into the system, most notably through its construction of the generation ship LDSS Nauvoo, designed to carry colonists to Tau Ceti in search of a new promised land.\nCore Beliefs\n\nEternal Progression: Human beings are divine in origin and capable of eternal growth and exaltation.\nThe Plan of Salvation: Life is part of a divine plan involving pre-mortal existence, mortal testing, and post-mortal ascension.\nFamily as Eternal Unit: Families can be sealed together eternally; procreation and family life are sacred duties.\nDivine Mission: Members are called to serve and spread the gospel, often through personal discipline and missionary outreach.\nPreparedness and Stewardship: Physical health, education, and emergency preparation are spiritual responsibilities.\n\nCore Doctrines\n\nRestorationism: Belief that the original church founded by Jesus was restored by Joseph Smith through divine revelation.\nScripture: Canon includes the Bible and the Book of Mormon, as well as modern prophetic revelations.\nAuthority: Divine priesthood authority is essential for performing sacred ordinances and guiding the Church.\nRevelation: God continues to reveal truth through modern prophets and personal inspiration.\nSelf-Governance: Emphasis on community governance through lay leadership and local councils.\n\nPractices and Symbols\n\nTemple Ordinances: Sacred rituals performed in temples symbolize eternal covenants and spiritual progression.\nMissionary Work: Members often serve missions throughout the solar system, seeking converts or aiding communities.\nHealth Codes: The Word of Wisdom proscribes alcohol, tobacco, and drugs, encouraging a clean, healthy lifestyle.\nSabbath Observance: Weekly worship and family focus on the Sabbath remain central, even aboard ships.\nSymbolism: The LDSS Nauvoo itself was a symbolic temple-ship, its name and structure referencing historical Nauvoo and the temples of Earth.\n\nSpread and Structure\n\nEarth-Based: The main body of the Church remains Earth-bound, with major centres in North America and the Pacific.\nInterplanetary Presence: LDS colonies and missions exist on Luna, Mars, and some Belt stations, though often as small enclaves.\nCentral Leadership: A First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles direct global Church operations, including space ventures.\nLocal Governance: Units called stakes, wards, and branches provide spiritual and logistical support to members throughout the system.\n\nDoctrine Tenets\n\nGod has a physical, perfected body and eternal purpose.\nJesus Christ is the Saviour, central to salvation and exaltation.\nThe family is eternal and central to God’s plan.\nAgency is sacred—each soul chooses salvation.\nRevelation continues through prophets and personal inspiration.\nHumans may become like God through obedience and grace.\nThe universe is populated by children of God; expansion is both physical and spiritual.\nScriptures are living texts, added to by divine will.\nWork and sacrifice are divine tools of transformation.\nMissionary and humanitarian service fulfil the call to gather Israel in the last days.\n\nControversies and Reactions\n\nNauvoo Incident: The commandeering of the LDSS Nauvoo by the OPA during the Eros crisis remains the Church’s most public trauma. Though done in a time of planetary emergency, it was seen by many Mormons as a violation of sacred purpose and property. Courts refused to hear their case due to political complexity, compounding the injury.\nPerceived Isolationism: The Church’s self-contained communities and cultural preservation sometimes create friction with the pluralistic and secular cultures of the Belt and Mars.\nLimited Visibility: Despite their massive investment in space infrastructure, the LDS Church has no major political role in system-wide governance and few public figures in Belt or Martian politics.\nStereotyping: Some non-members view the Church’s commitment to missionary work and family planning as outdated or controlling, though most LDS adherents in The Expanse are viewed as educated, resourceful, and peaceable.",

		"content": "Origins\nThe Martian Orthodox Church was born in the early generations of colonization, when settlers from China, India, and Texas found themselves struggling to survive in the harsh Martian environment. Bound by necessity, their traditions and philosophies blended into a new faith rooted in mutual responsibility and collective self-discipline. The name &quot;Orthodox&quot; was chosen not to mimic Earth religions, but to evoke a sense of continuity, order, and reverence for tradition amidst the chaos of planetary transformation.\nCore Beliefs\nAt its heart, Martian Orthodoxy teaches that salvation is terrestrial. One’s path to spiritual enlightenment is inseparable from the work of building Mars into a sustainable, flourishing world. The red planet is not a punishment or exile—it is a sacred responsibility.\n\nThe physical world is sacred, and Mars is to be cultivated as an inheritance.\nIndividual advancement must serve planetary and communal progress.\nDiscipline, humility, and industry are forms of worship.\nThe divine resides not in distant heavens, but in effort, improvement, and self-awareness.\n\nCore Doctrines\n\nRed Ascension – Humanity’s moral evolution is tied to the greening of Mars. As Mars transforms, so too must the soul.\nThe Dust Covenant – Each adherent pledges a vow of simplicity, rejecting luxury to remain focused on collective goals.\nDoctrine of Triple Duty – A faithful must contribute to:\n\nThe Self (through reflection and discipline),\nThe Community (through service),\nThe Planet (through labour and stewardship).\n\nThe Sacred Cycle – All resources—material, biological, spiritual—must be recycled. Waste is sacrilege.\n\nPractices and Symbols\n\nMeditation at Dawn and Dusk: Practiced facing Olympus Mons, symbolizing aspiration and perseverance.\nFasting Days (Red Quiet): Weekly periods of silence and abstinence from all unnecessary consumption.\nTatara Beads: Worn bracelets made from Martian hematite, each bead representing a commitment made or debt repaid.\nThe Crimson Thread: A red thread worn around the wrist or ankle by initiates, cut only after their first successful terraforming contribution.\nProscription of Meat and Excess: Animal products are forbidden. Residences are minimalist and self-cleaning.\nDevotional Work Logs: Daily records of one’s contributions to Mars, reviewed monthly with a spiritual advisor.\n\nSpread and Structure\nInitially concentrated in the Martian interior cities like Dhanbad Nova and Londres Nova, the faith spread through infrastructure crews, terraforming engineers, and agronomists. It has since developed a semi-hierarchical structure:\n\nThe Synod of Tharsis: A council of elders and engineers who debate doctrine and assign spiritual tasks.\nLocal Circles: Autonomous community groups that guide worship and coordinate local planetary service.\nRedwalkers: Missionaries and advisors who live among less developed Martian outposts, offering education and coordination aid.\n\nThe faith has minimal presence outside Mars, where its doctrines are often seen as overbearing or irrelevant.\nDoctrine Tenets\n\nTenet Name\nDescription\n\nLabor is Prayer\nProductive labor that aids Mars is equal to any ritual or sacrament.\n\nNo Salvation in Silence\nSpeech must lead to clarity or action—idle talk is discouraged.\n\nTend the Dust\nEnvironmental stewardship is the highest form of penance.\n\nDignity Through Effort\nOne’s worth is measured not by wealth but by service and struggle.\n\nThe Soil Recalls\nNothing is forgotten—every act leaves an imprint on Mars and the soul.\n\nControversies and Reactions\n\nTerran Backlash: Earth-based humanists and technocrats criticize the Martian Orthodox Church for being cult-like, overly ascetic, and too entwined with Martian nationalism.\nRed Extremists: Fringe sects within the Church advocate militant anti-terraforming views, believing Mars should remain sacred and unspoiled, even if it means stagnation.\nBelter Skepticism: Belters often view the faith as &quot;another Inners’ tool to keep people digging red dirt for nothing but guilt.&quot;\nCorporate Pushback: Terraforming corporations dislike the Church’s refusal to cooperate with for-profit projects and its fierce resistance to ecological shortcuts.",

		"content": "A Pastoral Letter from the Interplanetary Baptist Convention on the Meaning of the Eros Tragedy and the Witness of the Church\nDelivered from New Jerusalem Baptist Assembly, Atlanta, Earth\nDated: July 23, 2352\n\n“For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.”\n– Romans 8:22 (KJV)\n\nTo the churches of the Belt, Mars, Earth, and the far colonies,\nTo all Baptists labouring in the light of Christ’s grace, and to our brothers and sisters across the stars:\nWe write to you in mourning, in prayer, and in purpose. Six months have passed since the tragic and terrifying events at Eros Station, and yet the wound remains raw across our human family. What happened on that station—what was done to that station—has shaken the pillars of our world, both physical and spiritual.\nThis letter is not written in fear, but in faith. Not to speculate on the actions of governments or corporations, but to call the faithful to stand as a witness in the face of darkness.\nI. Eros and the Fall of Man\nThe events at Eros bear every mark of human sin. Greed, pride, and the desire to play god led powerful men to experiment with forces they neither understood nor respected. The result was death—not just the death of bodies, but of trust, of innocence, of our belief that some boundaries were still sacred.\nThe Bible tells us in Genesis that God gave dominion, not domination. Science and progress are gifts, but when they are wielded without righteousness, they become idols. Eros is not the wrath of God—it is the fruit of a godless ambition.\nII. The Blood Cries Out\nLike Abel’s blood in Genesis 4, the voices of those who perished cry out from Venus. We do not know all their names, but God does. And it is our duty to remember them—not only in prayer but in action. Let us not allow their memory to be buried in silence. Let their suffering stir the conscience of every believer.\nWe call on all Baptist churches and fellowships to observe Eros Memorial Sunday on the first Sunday of August each year, until justice is done and truth revealed.\nIII. The Role of the Church in the Belt and Beyond\nToo many of our brothers and sisters in the Belt live without comfort, without justice, and without hope. Many feel abandoned by Earth, by the powers that be—and even by God. Let us be clear: God has not forgotten them. And neither should we.\nThe Baptist Church is called to go where others will not. We encourage our pastors and lay missionaries to plant churches in neglected stations, to bring not only the Gospel, but food, medicine, and presence. In the quiet corners of Ceres, Pallas, and Ganymede, let Baptist churches be a refuge and a light.\nIV. Caution Before the Unknown\nThe Eros incident has shown us that we are not alone in the universe—not in the way we thought. Something ancient, something beyond comprehension, now moves among us. Theologians and scientists alike are struggling to name it. The Church must be wise.\nWe must resist both fear and fascination. Just as Paul warned against “science falsely so called” (1 Timothy 6:20), we warn against blind awe. The protomolecule is not a god. It does not deserve worship. It is not divine. Whether natural or unnatural, created or cursed, it is a test of discernment.\nV. A Call to Unity and Repentance\nEros is not only a tragedy. It is a mirror. It reflects the divisions we have allowed to fester—between Earth and Belt, Mars and Moon, rich and poor, corporate and forgotten. The time has come for confession.\nWe call on all Baptist churches to pray for reconciliation across the solar system. We ask believers to seek out neighbours from different worlds, different classes, even different beliefs—and break bread with them. The Kingdom of God is not bound to one planet.\nBrothers and sisters, hold fast. Do not be shaken by what you have seen. These are the days that test the soul, but they are also the days when faith shines brightest. Let us not cower beneath the shadow of Eros—but rise as a people of the Cross, carrying both truth and mercy.\nIn Christ and with great urgency,\nRev. Dr. Maynard Ellis\nModerator, Interplanetary Baptist Convention\nCo-signed by:\n\nThe Elders of the New Horizon Mission Fellowship (Ceres)\nThe Mars Baptist Association, Dhanbad Nova Chapter\nThe Belter Free Church Network\n\n&quot;Let us not grow weary in well doing, for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.&quot;\n— Galatians 6:9",

		"content": "Apostolic Exhortation of His Holiness Pope Urban X on the Moral Meaning of the Catastrophe of Eros\nIssued from the Vatican Apostolic Palace, Rome, Earth Anno Domini 2352\n\n&quot;Et facta est lux in tenebris, et tenebrae eam non comprehenderunt.&quot;\n(&quot;And the light shone in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.&quot;) — John 1:5\n\nTo all the faithful of the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, to our brethren in Christ throughout the Earth, Luna, Mars, and the Belt, and to all people of goodwill,\nGrace and peace be with you in this time of uncertainty. It is with a heart heavy with sorrow, but steadfast in the hope of Christ, that we address you concerning the cataclysm which has struck the human family: the dreadful event at Eros.\nSix months ago, a station that was once a beacon of human ingenuity became a tomb, its voice stolen, its orbit hijacked, its dignity profaned. Many thousands perished in silence, their lives extinguished by forces beyond our comprehension. To this day, the final truths of that event remain shrouded in mystery, hidden beneath the sulphuric clouds of Venus. But of this we are certain: it was not the will of God that His children suffer thus. It is not the Lord who sent this darkness upon us—but men, in their pride, who opened the door.\nI. On the Nature of Eros\nEros Station, in its final days, became the site of hubris. The weaponization of a foreign substance—what some have called the &quot;protomolecule&quot;—was an affront to the dignity of creation. The manipulation of life, not for the healing of wounds or the feeding of the poor, but for the service of power and dominion, is an abomination before Heaven.\nJust as Babel rose as a monument to man's vanity, so too did Eros fall as a monument to the same sin.\nII. On the Dignity of the Dead\nWe call upon all nations and corporations to honour the memory of those lost. The victims of Eros must not be reduced to statistics, nor forgotten in the pursuit of military or scientific advantage. Their deaths cry out for justice—and remembrance.\nWe hereby declare a day of solemn mourning to be observed annually across Catholic dioceses on the anniversary of Eros' fall. Bells shall toll, prayers shall be offered, and their names, where known, shall be read aloud in the liturgy of the hours.\nIII. On the Role of the Church\nWhere fear spreads, we shall spread faith. Where conspiracy and silence thrive, we shall speak truth. The Holy Church must not retreat to the safety of cathedrals and hab modules. We shall be present in the Belt, on Ganymede, in Tycho’s shadow—wherever our flock needs a shepherd.\nOur missionaries will accompany medical and humanitarian missions into the outer planets, offering not only solace, but listening hearts and firm moral witness.\nIV. On the Protomolecule and Human Limits\nLet it be known that the Church regards the protomolecule not as a divine gift, but as a test. We do not pretend to understand its origins, but neither must we bow to it as gods of old bowed to lightning and plague. The temptation to wield it—unhindered by conscience—is precisely what condemns the modern man to repeat the sins of Eden.\nScience, when severed from humility, becomes idolatry.\nV. A Call to Unity\nIn these days of tension between Earth, Mars, and the Belt, we remind all peoples that nationality, gravity, and genetics are nothing before God. We are one body in Christ. If the catastrophe of Eros teaches us anything, let it be that no world is immune to suffering, and no people free from the consequences of others’ sins.\nTherefore, we exhort the faithful to live not in fear, but in readiness. To build bridges, not barricades. To pray not for domination, but for wisdom.\nIn remembrance of the dead, in defence of the living, and in humility before creation,\nWe proclaim this Exhortation to be binding in all dioceses of the Church, and commend it to the contemplation of all who walk among the stars.\nGiven in Rome, at the Apostolic Palace,\nOn the Feast of St. Dominic, Patron of Astronomers,\nIn the year of Our Lord 2352.\nUrban X\nPontifex Maximus\nServus Servorum Dei",

		"content": "Fatwa No. 2352/0815 On the Catastrophe of Eros and the Responsibilities of the Ummah\nIssued by the Majlis al-Shura al-Islami lil-Nizam al-Shamsi\n(Council of Islamic Jurists for the Solar System)\nDate: 15 Muharram 1776 A.H. | August 10, 2352 C.E.\nLocation: Dar al-Ijtihad, Al-Quds Orbit, Earth\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful\n\n“And do not go about the earth spreading corruption.”\n— Surah Al-Baqarah (2:60)\n\nPreamble\nIn the wake of the destruction and desecration visited upon Eros Station by agents employing the substance known as the &quot;protomolecule,&quot; and in light of the loss of tens of thousands of innocent lives, the Majlis al-Shura al-Islami lil-Nizam al-Shamsi, comprising scholars and jurists from Earth, Mars, Luna, and the Belt, convened to reflect upon the religious and ethical dimensions of this event, and to issue guidance to the Ummah across the system.\nI. The Nature of the Eros Incident\nThe Eros catastrophe is not a divine punishment, nor is it to be interpreted as a sign of the Final Hour. Rather, it is the result of zulm (oppression), kibr (arrogance), and istighlal (exploitation)—sins committed by those who sought to manipulate what Allah has created without knowledge, mercy, or accountability.\nThe taking of innocent life on Eros constitutes mass murder, and those responsible—whether individuals, corporations, or state actors—are answerable before Allah. The Qur'an states:\n\n“Whoever kills a soul… it is as if he had slain all mankind.”\n— Surah Al-Ma’idah (5:32)\n\nII. On the Moral Boundaries of Scientific Inquiry\nIslam does not oppose science. It commands us to seek knowledge. But knowledge without conscience, power without wisdom, leads only to fitna (corruption).\nThe protomolecule is not inherently haram (forbidden), but its use as a weapon, and its deployment upon civilians, is munkar (an evil action). It is wajib (obligatory) for Muslim scientists, engineers, and decision-makers to uphold moral boundaries and refuse to partake in or enable such misuse.\nWe call for the creation of an Independent Solar Tribunal of Ethics, inclusive of scholars from all faiths and traditions, to oversee the handling of this and future extra-terrestrial phenomena.\nIII. On the Duty to Remember and Mourn\nThe victims of Eros must not be forgotten. We call upon the Ummah to:\n\nRecite Janazah Gha’ib (funeral prayers in absentia) on the 20th of Safar each year, corresponding to the anniversary of the Eros tragedy.\nEstablish permanent memorial khutbahs (sermons) in masajid (mosques) across the system reminding believers of the value of every human soul.\n\nIV. On the Role of the Ummah in the Belt and Beyond\nIt is fard kifayah (a communal obligation) for Muslims to be present where humanity suffers. The Belt, too long neglected by the powers of Earth and Mars, is home to many of our brothers and sisters in faith and in humanity.\nWe call for:\n\nThe expansion of Islamic relief missions to outer stations, especially Ceres, Ganymede, and Tycho.\nThe appointment of Imams and chaplains trained in both Islamic jurisprudence and interplanetary conditions.\nThe establishment of Dar al-Amn (Houses of Safety) in every sector where Muslims are present—places of prayer, rest, and refuge for all who seek peace.\n\nV. On the Question of Alien Origins and Tawhid\nThe existence of the protomolecule raises deep questions. Yet belief in Tawhid (the Oneness of Allah) remains firm.\nThe Qur’an tells us:\n\n“To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and whatever is between them and whatever is beneath the soil.”\n— Surah Taha (20:6)\n\nWhether the protomolecule is a natural phenomenon or a relic of a lost creation, it is part of Allah’s dominion. It must not be worshipped, feared, or used as justification for abandoning our deen (faith).\nFinal Declaration\nWe urge the Ummah:\n\nTo remain steadfast in prayer, and not fall into despair.\nTo seek justice, not revenge.\nTo act as a mercy to all creation, as the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was sent.\n\nMay Allah grant wisdom to our leaders, sabr (patience) to the afflicted, and guidance to all of humanity as we face these new trials among the stars.\nWa Allahu A'lam (And Allah knows best).\n\nSigned,\nSheikh Musa al-Hafnawi – Grand Mufti of the Belt\nDr. Yasmeen Khoury – Chair of the Martian Council of Scholars\nImam Qasim al-Rahman – President, Islamic Federation of Earth\nUstadh Harun Delgado – Lead Chaplain, Medina Habitat Station\nEndorsed by:\n\nThe High Council of Al-Azhar (Earth)\nThe Mars Shura Council\nThe Belter Association of Islamic Communities (BAIC)\nThe Lunar Muslim Association\n\nاللهم اجعلنا من الذين يستمعون القول فيتبعون أحسنه\n“O Allah, make us among those who listen to what is said and follow the best of it.” — Surah Az-Zumar (39:18)",

		"content": "A Solar Call to Reflection and Witness\nIssued by the United Council of Protestant Churches (UCPC)\nRegarding the Eros Tragedy and the Church’s Role in an Age of Uncertainty\nDate: August 5, 2352\nLocation: Geneva Synod Hall, Earth\n\n“God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore we will not fear, though the Earth gives way.”\n— Psalm 46:1–2a (ESV)\n\nTo all congregations in Earth orbit, on Mars, throughout the Belt, and in the deep black, grace and peace to you in the name of Jesus Christ our risen Lord.\nSix months have passed since the horror at Eros. In that time, humanity has looked into the void—and found it looking back. The loss of life, the unanswered questions, and the implications of a power beyond human origin have shaken the foundations of civilization and tested the soul of the Church.\nYet we proclaim with confidence: God is not silent. And the Church is not absent.\nI. A Tragedy Born of Human Sin\nLet us be clear. Eros was not a divine punishment nor a sign of end-times prophecy. It was a man-made catastrophe, rooted in sin—greed, pride, and the reckless pursuit of dominion. The use of a foreign agent—what many call the protomolecule—for purposes of control and power is a betrayal of humanity’s God-given stewardship.\nWe must repent of the systems—economic, scientific, and political—that allow such hubris to flourish unchecked.\nII. Bearing Witness to the Lost\nTens of thousands died on Eros. Most will never be named, their bodies scattered, their deaths concealed behind secrecy. But in Christ, no one dies forgotten.\nWe call upon all Protestant churches to dedicate the first Sunday of September each year as Eros Memorial Sunday. Let every congregation remember the dead with prayer, silence, and the lighting of candles. Let us say their names when they are known, and honor their humanity when they are not.\nIII. The Mission of the Church in This Moment\nThis is not the time for retreat. The Church must step boldly into the breach.\n\nOn Ceres, on Ganymede, and on orbital platforms above Mars, our pastors and chaplains must be visible, available, and accountable.\nHumanitarian relief must be coupled with spiritual care.\nWe encourage the planting of new congregations in underserved Belter communities, with support from Earth-based fellowships.\n\nWe remind our missionaries and ministers that our calling is not to control narratives, but to embody Christ’s love—especially where injustice thrives and hope runs thin.\nIV. Concerning the Protomolecule\nThe Church affirms that creation is God's alone, and while scientific exploration is part of humanity’s God-given vocation, any attempt to harness unknown life for power or profit without moral discernment is sin.\nWe urge research bodies, governments, and corporate actors to:\n\nCommit to transparency in studying the protomolecule.\nSubmit such studies to civilian oversight and independent ethical review.\nRefrain from weaponizing or exploiting unknown biology until its nature is understood and its use justified under moral law.\n\nThe Church will not offer blind condemnation, nor will it offer blind blessing.\nV. A Word of Hope in a Shaken Time\nThe Eros incident has instilled fear in many. Some whisper that we are on the brink of apocalypse. Others have begun to worship the unknown. Both responses arise from despair.\nLet the Church respond instead with hope.\nGod is not threatened by alien biology. Our hope is not in what we understand, but in whom we trust. And we trust a God who raised Jesus from the dead, and who is not diminished by mystery.\nLet this decree be distributed to all Protestant councils and mission fellowships across the system. Let it be preached in pulpits, discussed in Bible studies, and prayed over in homes.\nThe time is urgent, but the Gospel endures.\nWe go forward in faith—not because we understand everything, but because we are held by the One who does.\nIn Christ's service,\nRev. Dr. Erika Maloumi\nModerator, United Council of Protestant Churches\nCo-signed by:\n\nThe Solar Methodist Federation\nThe Augsburg Interplanetary Communion\nThe Free Mars Reformed Church\nThe Beltline Baptist Fellowship\nThe Evangelical Lutheran Union\nThe Ganymede Outreach Network\n\n&quot;The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.&quot; — John 1:5",

		"content": "In The Expanse Roleplaying Game, character bonds are a crucial aspect of interpersonal connections, representing the intimate ties that form between Player Characters (PCs) and even between PCs and their ship. These relationships can be deliberately developed or arise from circumstances.\nNature of the Bond (Relationship Bond)\n\nThe &quot;Relationship Bond&quot; defines the specific nature of the connection between characters, such as friendship, animosity, or romance.\nBonds can range from straightforward to highly complex.\nExamples of such bonds include statements like: &quot;I would risk my life for you,&quot; &quot;I won't stop until you are dead,&quot; &quot;We've gone through hell together,&quot; &quot;I trust you to be my conscience,&quot; and &quot;You are someone I love and respect, but we can never be together in the way I want&quot;.\nBoth the Game Master (GM) and players should understand the foundation of a Bond and track its evolution over time.\n\nStrength of the Bond (Relationship Intensity)\n\nBeyond its nature, a bond also has an Intensity rating, from 1 to 5, which signifies its strength .\nAn Intensity of 1 denotes a new but significant relationship, while an Intensity of 5 represents a profound, once-in-a-lifetime connection.\nMechanical Benefit: For each rank of Intensity, a character receives a free stunt point (SP) at the start of each game session. These SP can only be used for stunts that directly involve or are connected to the relationship, and can only be spent once per session. They can be combined with SP generated from rolling doubles.\n\nFormation and Evolution of Bonds\n\nIdeally, relationships and bonds should form organically during play, developing from character interactions.\nDuring character creation, players can establish initial connections by choosing &quot;Ties&quot; to other group members, promoting early group cohesion.\nCharacters can actively work to forge new bonds or modify existing ones by performing the &quot;Relating&quot; interlude activity. This activity requires time and a willing participant, or circumstances that necessitate it.\nIntensity can change over time, waxing or waning. Players and GMs should review relationships when a character gains a level to decide if the Bond type or Intensity shifts. Increasing Intensity by one step typically requires a number of interludes equal to the desired Intensity level.\n\nShip Bonds\n\nBeyond character-to-character relationships, ships can also form bonds with their crew members. This is often a deeply personal and absolute connection, as the crew relies on the ship for survival in space.\nLike character relationships, Ship Bonds are described from the character's perspective and guide the tone of their interactions with the vessel.\nShip Bonds also have an Intensity rating (1 to 5), with each rank granting a free stunt point exclusively for stunts related to the ship.\nThese bonds can be increased or forged by undertaking &quot;Maintenance&quot; or &quot;Making or Fixing&quot; activities during an interlude, or by crews spending time &quot;Relating&quot; on the ship.\nWhile Ship Bond Intensity can decrease if a character spends a significant amount of time away from the vessel, it can never drop below 1 unless the ship is destroyed.",

Until the start of your next turn, you gain a +2 bonus to your Defence.\n\nMelee Attack\nYou attack an enemy within 2 meters of you in hand-to-hand combat (see Making Attacks).\n\nRanged Attack\nYou fire or throw a ranged weapon at one visible enemy within range (see Making Attacks).\n\nRun\nYou move up to twice your Speed in meters, sacrificing the ability to perform another action so you can move farther. You cannot take this action if you are prone (you’d need to use the Move minor action to stand up first).\n\nStunt Attack\nInstead of trying to damage an opponent, you focus on performing a specific action stunt, like subduing an enemy with a hold instead of hurting them (a Grapple stunt). Roll an attack test as usual. A successful test awards you 1 SP of a type appropriate for the attack, but the attack itself inflicts no damage. If you roll doubles, you earn additional SP as normal and may choose a stunt that damages your opponent, but there is still no damage from the base attack. You can attempt stunt attacks against objects as well as opponents, though the GM may rule that some stunts do not apply.\n\nMinor Actions\n\nAction\nDetails\n\nActivate\nThis action allows you to start using certain abilities or items, such as certain talents or technology.\n\nAim\nYou take the measure of your opponent and plan your next strike. If your next action after Aim is a melee or ranged attack, you gain a +1 bonus on your attack roll.\n\nGuard Up\nYou balance action and defense. Add +1 or +2 (your choice) to your Defense until the end of the round. However, the same modifier becomes a penalty to all tests you make, even opposed tests, until the end of the round as well (unlike the Defend action, which lasts until the beginning of your next turn). If you choose this minor action, you must do it before any major action on your turn, and you cannot Defend on the same turn.\n\nMove\nYou move up to your Speed in meters and can combine this with actions like dropping prone, standing up, or climbing into a vehicle, but each of these types of actions consumes half your Speed (rounded down).\n\nPrepare\nWhen you take this action, you postpone your major action. You declare one major action and your choice to Prepare it. After you do so, the next person in the initiative order acts, and so on, but at any time until the beginning of your next turn, you can interrupt another character and take your prepared action immediately. If you don’t use the prepared action by your next turn, you lose it.\n\nPress the Attack\nYou stand ready to pursue an enemy if they fall back or flee. You can take this action after successfully striking an enemy target with a melee attack (whether you inflict damage or not). After you declare this action, if that foe moves away from you, you may immediately move up to your Speed in meters in direct pursuit at no additional cost in actions. This occurs immediately after your foe’s movement, before they can do anything else.\n\nReady\nYou draw a weapon, pull out a device, or otherwise ready a stowed item. As part of this action, you can put away something already in hand. You could holster a pistol and pull out a grenade with the same Ready action, for example.\n\nStand Firm\nYou stand firm and prepare to resist any effort to move you. Until the start of your next turn, any enemy using the Skirmish or Knock Prone stunts to move you or knock you to the ground must succeed in an opposed test of their Strength (Might) against your choice of your own Strength (Might) or Dexterity (Acrobatics). If you win the test, the attempt fails. If the attacker wins, the attempt proceeds normally. The attacker still spends the stunt points, regardless of whether the attempt to move you succeeds or fails.\n\nAttack Roll Modifiers\n\nModifier\nCircumstance\n\n-5\nAttacker is blind or otherwise completely unable to see the target.\n\n-3\nDefender in heavy cover, such as a building or stone wall. Melee attacker in heavy snow.\n\n-2\nDefender in light cover, such as a hedge or the woods. Melee attacker in the mud. Ranged attack vs. defender engaged in melee combat. Combat at night.\n\n-1\nRain, mist, or smoke obscures the defender. Combat in low light conditions.\n\n0\nNormal circumstances.\n\n+1\nAttacker is on higher ground. Defender is prone. Melee attacker and allies outnumber defender 2 to 1.\n\n+2\nMelee attacker and allies outnumber defender 3 to 1. Defender is drunk.\n\n+3\nDefender is unaware of the attack.\n\nMorale Tests\nCharacters who fail a Willpower (Morale) test attempt to break off from combat or even surrender.\nConditions triggering a morale test:\n\nWhen more than half of the side’s combatants are taken out of the fight\nWhen the side’s leader or champion is taken out of the fight\nWhen fighting on will clearly mean being trapped or surrounded\nWhen the other side reveals a serious or over whelming advantage\nWhen they fail an opposed TN15 Persuasion test.",

		"content": "General\n\nName\nEffect\n\nBlinded\nA blinded character cannot see and automatically fails ability tests reliant on sight, such as Perception (Seeing).\n\nDeafened\nThe character cannot hear and automatically fails ability tests reliant on hearing, such as Perception (Hearing).\n\nFree Falling\nThe character is effectively weightless in a microgravity or free-fall environment. The character can only move with access to hand-holds, a surface to push off from, or some type of thrust (like from a thruster pack) and, once moving, continues to move with the same speed and trajectory unless acted upon to stop or change their movement.\n\nHindered\nThe character’s Speed is halved (round down) and they cannot take the Charge or Run actions.\n\nProne\nThe character is lying on the ground. The character cannot take the Charge or Run actions, as they can only move by crawling, and standing up from prone requires a Move action using half the character’s Speed. Melee attacks have a +1 bonus against prone characters, while ranged attacks have a –1 penalty.\n\nRestrained\nThe character’s Speed becomes 0 and they effectively cannot move. A restrained condition may prevent a character from taking certain other actions as well, defined by the nature of the restraint.\n\nHealth\n\nName\nEffect\n\nInjured\nThe character is hurt. The character has a –1 penalty to all tests and is fatigued, unable to take the Charge or Run actions. An injured character who receives an additional injured condition becomes wounded.\n\nWounded\nThe character is severely injured. The character has a –2 penalty to all tests and is exhausted, their Speed halved and unable to take the Charge or Run actions. A wounded character who receives an additional injured or wounded condition becomes dying.\n\nDying\nThe character is in danger of perishing. A dying character loses 1 point of Constitution score each round on the start of the character’s turn. When the character’s Constitution score reaches –3, the character dies. Successful first aid applied to a dying character stabilizes their condition, making them helpless, unconscious, and wounded instead. They must recover from these conditions normally (see Interludes in Chapter 5).\n\nHelpless\nThe character is incapable of doing anything. The character cannot take any actions.\n\nUnconscious\nThe character is unaware of their surroundings or the passage of time. The character falls prone and is helpless, unable to take any actions.\n\nStamina\n\nName\nEffect\n\nFatigued\nThe character is tired and cannot take the Charge or Run actions. A fatigued character who receives an additional fatigued condition becomes exhausted.\n\nExhausted\nThe character is severely fatigued. The character’s Speed is halved and they cannot take the Charge or Run actions. An exhausted character who receives an additional fatigued or exhausted condition becomes helpless.\n\nHelpless\nThe character is incapable of doing anything. The character cannot take any actions.",

		"content": "Each quality -&gt; cost +1\nEach flaw -&gt; cost - 1\nGeneral Qualities\n\nQuality\nEffect\n\nDurable\nThe item is built to last. Under normal conditions, it lasts twice as long and for tests involving damaging it, it has +2 Toughness.\n\nEffective\nThe item works better than a regular item of its type, gaining a +1 bonus to one of its abilities. This could be damage, armour bonus, or some other ability used for outcome or effectiveness but not for tests (see Fine, following, for that quality) or a 50% improvement in overall output. A Very Effective item has two qualities and provides a +2 bonus or a 100% improvement.\n\nFast\nThe item works fast. It takes half the usual time to use a regular item of its type. For something used during action time, the character gains a +2 bonus to initiative when using the item\n\nFavoured Stunt\nThe item is either especially well-suited for performing a particular stunt, granting a –1 SP modifier to its cost, or else the item grants access to a unique stunt the character can perform while wielding or using it. Each favoured stunt is a separate quality and an item can have more than one.\n\nFine\nThe item’s quality is such that the character gains a +1 bonus to tests for using or wielding it. Very Fine items have two qualities and provide a +2 bonus.\n\nImpressive\nThe item’s quality is clearly apparent, providing a +1 bonus to social and roleplaying tests where such things are noteworthy, such as trying to make a good impression while wearing an Impressive outfit or intimidating someone with an Impressive weapon. Very Impressive items have two qualities and provide a +2 bonus.\n\nLight\nThe item is lighter and more compact than normal, reducing any penalty to Dexterity and Speed it normally imposes by 1. Very Light items have two qualities and reduce penalties by 2.\n\nGeneral Flaws\n\nFlaw\nEffect\n\nFragile\nThe item wasn’t made to take much punishment. A deliberate attempt to break it always succeeds. Further more, when a test to use the item fails and the Drama Die is 3 or less, the item breaks.\n\nHeavy\nThe item is heavier or bulkier than normal, imposing a –1 penalty to the Dexterity and Speed of a character carrying or wearing it. Very Heavy items have two flaws and impose a –2 penalty to Dexterity and Speed.\n\nIneffective\nThe item can’t inflict damage as easily as a proper weapon, imposing a –1 or –2 penalty to damage rolls, with a minimum damage roll of 1.\n\nPoor\nThe overall poor quality of the item imposes a –1 penalty to tests using or wielding it. Very Poor items have two flaws and impose a –2 penalty.\n\nShoddy\nThe item’s flaws are glaringly apparent, imposing a –1 penalty to social and roleplaying tests where such things are noteworthy, such as trying to intimidate someone with a Shoddy weapon, or make a good first impression in a Shoddy outfit. The GM may adjust the penalty, depending on the circumstances, but it is always negative.\n\nSlow\nThe item works, but not fast. It takes twice as much time to use as a regular item of its type. For something that can be used with a major action during action time, a Slow item requires a Ready action after it is used each time to prepare it to be used again.\n\nUnreliable\nThe item works...most of the time. When a test involving the item fails and the Drama Die is a 3 or less, the item stops working. If the item does not require a test to use, the GM should roll 3d6 when the item needs to work. On a total roll of 10 or less where the Drama Die is a 3 or less, the item stops working. Getting an Unreliable item working again takes either an interlude to fix it or, during action time, a TN 13 challenge test with a success threshold of 10 and a time increment of 1 round.\n\nRanged Weapon Qualities\n\nQuality\nEffect\n\nArmor Piercing\nThe weapon’s rounds reduce the Toughness bonus of worn armour by –2 in terms of reducing their damage. Unfortunately, armour-piercing rounds also have the ability to punch through vacuum sealed bulkheads, so a missed attack with one on a spaceship or station near an outside wall may cause a hull breach. Roll 1d6; on a roll of 1 or 2, a breach occurs and the air begins rushing out of the compartment. See the Threats chapter for details on suffocation hazards\n\nAutomatic\nThe weapon reloads and fires automatically so long as its trigger is depressed. This makes the weapon capable of performing stunts with the (Automatic) quality on the Gun Stunts table in Chapter 5.\n\nHigh Capacity\nThe weapon carries a substantial amount of ammunition. Ignore the first roll indicating the weapon has run out of ammo (see Weapon Capacity, following).\n\nLong Range\nThe weapon’s effective ranges are doubled. See Range under Making Attacks in Chapter 5 for details.\n\nSpreading\nThe weapon fires a spreading cone of pellets, shot, or similar small ammunition, like a shotgun. It does one die less damage, but can hit all targets within a roughly 30-degree angle in front of the shooter.\n\nTracer\nThe weapon fires rounds that glow, leaving visible trails (tracers) behind. A tracer weapon allows the user to take the Aim action as a free action so long as the weapon was fired on the previous round (see Aim under Minor Actions in Chapter 5).\n\nTranquilizer\nA tranquilizer or tranq weapon fires a hypodermic dart preloaded with a dose of a drug, usually a powerful tranquilizer to knock out its target. The dart won’t penetrate any armour, but if it hits an unarmoured target, the character must make a TN 13 Constitution (Tolerance) test or become unconscious. A successful test means the character is only fatigued.\n\nMakeshift Weapon Flaws\n\nFlaw\nEffect\n\nClumsy\nThe weapon is awkward to wield, imposing a –1 or –2 penalty to attack tests.\n\nFragile\nThe weapon wasn’t made to take much punishment. When an attack with it misses and the Drama Die is 3 or less, the object breaks and becomes useless as a weapon\n\nWeak\nThe object can’t inflict damage as easily as a proper weapon, imposing a –1 or –2 penalty to damage rolls, with a minimum damage roll of 1.",

		"title": "Honorifics",
		"date":"Sun Aug 03 2025 04:01:39 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)",
		"url":"/diomedes-spear/rules/honorifics/",
		"content": "Honorifics are titles or nicknames that a character or a ship earns, representing their reputation within the world of The Expanse Roleplaying Game . They are a form of reward that characters gain for their deeds, or even simply due to rumours about them.\nPurpose and Nature\n\nPublic Standing: Honorifics measure a character's or ship's public standing . For bounty hunters, reputation is crucial for attracting clients, while a poor reputation can make finding work difficult. Similarly, a planetary surveyor's or scout's reputation affects job offers, and for traders and smugglers, reputation is their &quot;lifeblood&quot;, influencing access to legitimate or high-risk jobs. An Entertainer can have VIP Access for their ship due to their celebrity status, reducing fees and repair times.\nInfluence and Access: They can be leveraged to smooth social interactions or gain access to resources and opportunities otherwise out of reach. For example, a journalist's press identifier broadcasts their credentials, flagging them as a non-combatant and reducing their chances of arrest or being shot.\nSituational: Honorifics are potent but situational. A champion athlete's fame in sports may not help in a political debate unless directly related. The GM has the final say on when an honorific applies mechanically.\nDynamic: They are rarely permanent and can fade or change based on conflicting evidence or new actions. They don't even need to be entirely deserved or true.\n\nGaining and Losing Honorifics\n\nAcquisition: Honorifics usually arise from a character's actions in play. Characters can choose a reputation (honorific) as an improvement from their character's drive during creation.\nMaintenance/Change: Characters can spend time during interludes performing the &quot;Reputation&quot; activity to bolster, diminish, or create a new honorific. This often involves making their actions known, such as giving interviews or broadcasting videos. The GM decides when a character has done enough to gain or lose a specific reputation; System-wide notoriety might require more than a few interludes to influence .\nAbility Test (Optional): A Game Master may require a Communication (Expression or Performing) test to measure the effectiveness of efforts to influence reputation.\n\nTypes of Honorifics and their Mechanical Effects\nHonorifics provide mechanical benefits, often tied to ability tests. Conversely, bad reputations reverse these benefits into penalties, and can be eliminated through &quot;Reputation&quot; interlude activities.\n\nPersonal Reputation: When a character invokes their honorific (or the story of how they gained it), opponents suffer a -1 penalty on opposed tests against them, particularly when the test involves the character's famed skill or natural ability.\n\nBad Personal Reputation: Opponents gain a +1 bonus on opposed tests.\n\nSupportive Reputation: When others (friends or foes) talk up a character's title, the character gains a +2 bonus to rolls demonstrating their known abilities in that scene.\n\nBad Supportive Reputation: Relevant test target numbers increase by +2 for the character.\n\nInspired Reputation: Using an honorific outside its typical field (an &quot;inspired purpose&quot;) grants a +1 bonus to the Drama Die result when the player demonstrates clever use of the honorific for an aim.\n\nBad Inspired Reputation: Tests in relevant areas suffer a -1 penalty to the stunt points generated on the Drama Die.\n\nPassive Reputation: In social situations where a group or individual is aware of the reputation, the character benefits from a free, single-step attitude shift (positive or negative) in the direction suited to their reputation.\n\nBad Passive Reputation: Tends to worsen attitudes and can lead to increased scrutiny from authorities.\n\nReputation Spread (RS)\nThe impact of a reputation is only meaningful if others have heard of it. Reputation Spread is a dynamic rating (0–5) that tracks how far your reputation has travelled across the system.\n\nRS\nSpread Level\nDescription\n\n0\nUnknown\nOnly your crew and direct contacts know of your actions. No mechanical effect.\n\n1\nLocal\nKnown within a station or small cluster (e.g., Ceres or Tycho).\n\n2\nRegional\nTalked about across an orbit (e.g., Belt or Inner Mars stations).\n\n3\nSystemic\nWhispers about your name float through multiple planetary zones.\n\n4\nFactional\nMajor factions track you, and your name is recognized by agents and contractors.\n\n5\nLegendary\nYour name is known across the entire system—loved, feared, or both.\n\nShip Honorifics\nShips, like characters, can also gain reputations and honorifics based on their history and their crew's collective actions. These can inspire respect or fear.\n\nShip honorifics have the same four categories (Personal, Supportive, Inspired, Passive) with similar mechanical effects as character honorifics.\nSome ship honorifics are historical facts, like a former name or captain, which might provide narrative flavour but no mechanical benefit or even a detriment.\n\nExamples of Honorifics\n\nThe Absolute: A paragon of a sub-culture or cause, beloved by allies and attacked by opponents. (e.g., Absolute Professional for Bounty Hunters)\nBane of the Belt: For those who crusade against pirates and OPA terrorists.\nChampion Athlete: A star in their chosen sport.\nDestined for Greatness: Character succeeds beyond expectations, creating rivals.\nExpert in the Field: Recognised for knowledge and achievements in a professional pursuit. (e.g., Expert Bounty Hunter, Expert Surveyor, Expert Scout, Expert Smuggler/Trader).\nLoyal: Known for sticking to friends or employers, even at personal cost.\nLucky: Things always seem to work out for them, but this breeds resentment.\nNatural Aptitude: Admired for innate ability rather than training.\nProtector of Innocents: Known for defending those who cannot defend themselves. (e.g., Protector of the Underdog for Bounty Hunters, Merciful for Pirates).\nSuperlative Lover: Known for romantic and sexual prowess and compassion.\nSurvivor: Has faced disasters and come through unscathed. (e.g., Sailed a Thousand Light Years for Pirates).\nTrue OPA: Seen as a loyal member of rebellious OPA factions. (e.g., Eyes of the OPA for Scouts).\nDeep Space Dweller: Spends more time in deep space than on planetary bodies.\nAll the Best Stuff: Focuses on delivering specific high-quality cargo.\nExpedited Deliverer: Known for speed in transport.\nZookeeper: Transports alien life-forms.\nOstentatious: A ship that draws attention wherever it goes, good for impressions but also a target for unsavoury types.",

When a character is not active within that organisation, their reputation will wane. Practically meaning that the character will drop one membership rank. This drop in rank can represent disapproval from organisation member or leadership, or even the effects of undermining by opposed factions within the organisation.\nWhen your character's in-game activities are not associated with the their organisation, they can remain active within that organisation by dedicating one interlude shift a week to advancement within the organisation. The activity within that shift can be varied, from responding to communications through to researching for them or providing them with information. I may be character initiated or come as a request from the organisation.\nArmed Combat Training\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs desired\n\nEffect\nAccrue accuracy bonuses\n\nFocus\nAccuracy\n\nAlright, there isn't enough room for a shooting range, but luckily Mars solved that. There wasn't much sense in training all those Redboots then letting them go soft, so Mars developed a helmet based combat simulator that connects directly with weapons their Marine's weapons. Lucky for the rest of us, not all Martian are as patriotic as we are led to believe, and these simulators soon made their way onto the black market.\nWhen a character dedicates an interlude shift to armed combat training they can accrue accuracy bonuses. These bonuses can be spent to boost an accuracy roll by +2. Once a bonus is spent it is gone.\nCharacters roll a straight accuracy skill test against TN 13. If they pass, the drama die is the number of accuracy bonuses they have accrued.\nA character may perform this activity once in an interlude.\nAudit\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nOnce a week\n\nEffect\n+2 to relevant rolls\n\nFocus\nN/A\n\nLiving in a little metal tube amidst the vastness of space can be challenging. You need to carry everything that you need with you. Importantly you also need to make sure that you actually have what you think you have. A crew member who is a 'midnight snacker' or 'liberal with the pain relief', a leaky water line, insufficient scrubbers, or a inaccurate ammunition counter can result in a discrepancy between what your records say you have, and what you actually have. This shortfall can have implication when resupplying, or, more consequentially, in times of crisis (eg. Churn Events, post-combat recovery).\nHaving a accurate understanding of your starting point mitigates complications. Having a recent stocktake (within one week) will grant a +2 to all rolls that relate to needing accurate records. For example, post combat and your ships reaction mass storage has been damaged. The pilot will receive a +2 to calculating manoeuvres so they ensure the reaction mass doesn't run out.\nCleaning\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift per ability test in an Advance Test\n\nFrequency\nWhen required\n\nEffect\nRemoves the need for crew to perform challenge tests\n\nFocus\nConstitution (Tolerance)\n\nNormal cleaning is a day-to-day occurrence that doesn't need to be factored into interludes. This kind of clearing refers to the removal of pollutants or hazardous materials that spaceship carry around with them. Normally this material stays in it's appropriate locations and is removed as part of a resupply at docking facilities, but sometimes emergencies happen. If the pollutants or hazardous materials are not cleaned the crew will be at risk of developing conditions. They will requires Constitution (Tolerance) challenge tests, with consequences like increased difficulty or developing conditions\nThe cleaning of pollutants and hazardous materials is an advanced test, with the success threshold (ST) and the target number (TN) set by the GM. To make an ability test against the TN, one player will need to allocate an interlude shift to cleaning. If successful, they will add the drama die points to the accumulated progress towards the ST.\nIf an additional player wishes to assist, they too will have to allocate an interlude shift. If they succeed in a ability test towards against the TN, they add +2 to the cleaner's ability test.\nCommunication\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift provides a calculated number of test\n\nFrequency\nWhen required\n\nEffect\nPerform communications ability tests\n\nFocus\nCommunication focus\n\nCommunicating over space distances is different to local communication. Even after just one day of 1/3g burn, there is a minute delay between a message being sent and it being received. Allowing for time spend composing, recording at returning a response, you would be unlikely to get a response earlier than five minutes. At that's close.

This complication means that any advanced form of communication (involving the communication focuses) is time consuming.\nTo engage in any form of communication test remotely, your character will need to allocate an interlude shift. The number of tests you character can perform in this shift, will depend on the distance of the communication.\nNumber of tests = 480mins / (Communication Distance + 10mins x 2)\nFor example, a character can perform 13 test if they are communication from Ceres to Tycho, but only 6 if they are communicating with someone in the Saturnian system.\nEquipment Adjustment\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nMinimum of one interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs desired\n\nEffect\nPerform advanced engineering or technical tests towards equipment improvement\n\nFocus\nIntelligence (Engineering) or Intelligence (Technology)\n\nAdjusting equipment is essential in the variable, unpredictable environments of space where one-size-fits-all rarely applies. Vacuum seals wear unevenly, magnetic boots lose calibration, and tools designed for Martian gravity might fail under Belt micro-g. Belters tweak filters to stretch their lifespan; Martian marines modify armour seals to survive long burns. In tight ship quarters or aging stations, factory defaults aren't good enough -- tuning gear to your body, your task, and your environment keeps you alive. Whether it’s recalibrating a rifle’s zero for shipboard recoil, reinforcing an EVA suit for radiation, or jury-rigging a drone’s sensor array, adjustments make equipment personal, efficient, and reliable. During an Interlude, such adjustments justify mechanical bonuses and reflect the hard-earned lessons that separate spacers who just survive from those who thrive.\nAdjusting equipment by adding or removing attributes requires a player to perform an advanced technology or engineering test, using the Target numbers and success threshold below.\nThe equipment can only be worked on during interlude time, and each test expends one unit of interlude time.\nWhilst the equipment is being worked on, it is out of commission.\nSuccess Threshold\nThe success threshold required to add or remove on attribute.\n\nEquipment Type\nSuccess Threshold\n\nLight Close\n6\n\nHeavy Close\n7\n\nPistol\n10\n\nRifle\n12\n\nGrenade\n15\n\nPadded Armour\n8\n\nLight Armour\n12\n\nMedium Armour\n14\n\nHeavy Armour\n16\n\nRiot Shield\n13\n\nBallistic Shield\n14\n\nHand Terminal\n8\n\nHead-up Display\n10\n\nHUD Expert System\n12\n\nTerminals\n12\n\nTerminal Expert System\n14\n\nDrone\n14\n\nCombat Drone\n16\n\nButterfly Drone\n16\n\nGadfly Drone\n12\n\nCommunications Drone\n16\n\nDecoy Drone\n15\n\nDrone Augmentation\n20\n\nProbe\n17\n\nShoulder Mech\n15\n\nConstruction Mech\n15\n\nEnvironment Suit\n9\n\nVac Suit\n11\n\nForm-fitting Suit\n13\n\nTool Kit\n8\n\nWorkshop\n10\n\nBypass\n11\n\nRestraints\n7\n\nSedatives\n9\n\nElectronic Surveillance\n9\n\nPress ID\n6\n\nBurn Key\n10\n\nGhost in a Can\n14\n\nEMP Drill Hound\n14\n\nBoarding Wedge\n13\n\nPlumes of Io\n10\n\nShip Napping Expert Systems\n12\n\nShip Pathfinding Expert Systems\n15\n\nShip Pattern Searching Expert System\n20\n\nShip Scientific Analysis Expert System\n20\n\nTarget Numbers\nThe target number for each attribute.\n\nAttribute\nTarget number\n\nDurable\n17\n\nFragile\n17\n\nVery Effective\n19\n\nEffective\n17\n\nIneffective\n17\n\nVery Ineffective\n19\n\nFast\n17\n\nSlow\n17\n\nFavoured Stunt\n17\n\nVery Fine\n19\n\nFine\n17\n\nPoor\n17\n\nVery Poor\n19\n\nVery Impressive\n19\n\nImpressive\n17\n\nShoddy\n17\n\nVery Shoddy\n19\n\nUnreliable\n17\n\nArmour Piercing\n17\n\nTranquilizer\n17\n\nAutomatic\n17\n\nHigh Capacity\n17\n\nLong Range\n17\n\nSpreading\n17\n\nTracer\n17\n\nStunning\n17\n\nEquipment Maintenance\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nOnce a week\n\nEffect\nPrevent equipment from developing flaws\n\nFocus\nN/A\n\nIn the harshness of space you need to be able to rely on your equipment.

Character can prevent this by dedicating an interlude shift to maintain your equipment. The character will only require one shift to maintain all their personal equipment.\nFailure to maintain equipment\nIf a characters equipment has not been maintain in the past week, then the player has to roll on each equipment item (equipment being adjusted is excluded). If they roll a 1 2 or 3, that item will develop a random temporary flaw until. This flaw will be removed by it's next maintenance. The number of dice rolled is equal to the number of weeks it has been without maintenance (ie. after two weeks without maintenance, roll two dice).\n\nRoll\nTemporary Flaw\n\n1\nFragile\n\n2\nIneffective\n\n3\nVery Ineffective\n\n4\nSlow\n\n5\nPoor\n\n6\nVery Poor\n\n7\nShoddy\n\n8\nVery Shoddy\n\n9\nUnreliable\n\n10\nRoll again\n\nEquipment Manufacture\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nMinimum of one interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs desired\n\nEffect\nPerform advanced engineering or technical tests towards equipment manufacture\n\nFocus\nDexterity (Crafting) or Intelligence (Engineering)\n\nEquipment manufacture is a necessity born of distance, scarcity, and independence in the Expanse. Far from Earth’s supply lines and Martian factories, Belters, outstation crews, and smugglers can’t rely on resupply or standard issue -- they must build what they need from what they have. Whether it’s forging replacement air filters from scavenged parts, printing custom weapon mods on a fabricators, or assembling drone components out of mining scraps, manufacturing gear in-house is often the only way to stay operational. It allows crews to tailor tools for unique missions, create backups of critical systems, and maintain autonomy from corporate or faction control. In the Belt, if you can’t build it, you’d better trade for it -- or go without.\nTo manufacture equipment a character must meet certain requirements:\n\nMaterials: The character needs the appropriate raw materials for the item. Unrestricted materials can be acquired by making an Income test against a Target Number (TN) equal to the item's value minus 5.\nTools and Equipment: Necessary tools and a workshop are crucial.\nAppropriate Focus: A character must possess a suitable &quot;manufacturing focus&quot;.\n\nDexterity (Crafting) -&gt; hand-crafted and artistic items\nIntelligence (Engineering) -&gt; technological items.\n\nCreating an item from scratch is resolved using an advanced test:\n\nTarget Number (TN): The TN for the test is the equivalent to the Equipment Adjustment Success Threshold\nSuccess Threshold: The GM determines a success threshold based on the item's complexity:\n\n5 for a simple item.\n10 to 15 for more complex items.\n20 to 25 for truly complex works or pieces of equipment.\n\nFor each interlude shift a character dedicates to equipment manufacture, they can roll one advance test.\nExperimentation\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nMinimum of one interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs desired\n\nEffect\nDouble advanced test towards developing new technology concepts\n\nFocus\n2 different Intelligence focuses\n\nExperimental tinkering is the engine of survival and progress in a system built on unreliable tech, recycled parts, and desperate innovation. Nowhere is this clearer than in the origin of the Epstein Drive itself -- a breakthrough born not in a government lab, but in a personal garage. Solomon Epstein’s overdrive of a fusion engine during personal experimentation led to the single greatest leap in human expansion, unlocking efficient long-burn travel and opening the Belt, the moons, and beyond. That spirit of hands-on experimentation still defines the frontier: Belter mechanics modulate scrubbers using salvaged Martian code, smugglers tweak sensor profiles to avoid detection, and pirates wire up disposable thrusters from mining equipment. In a setting where blueprints are outdated and factory parts are scarce, tinkering turns scrap into solutions, giving characters a chance to innovate, adapt, and sometimes create the next big thing -- just like Epstein did, burning too hard and too far, but changing the system forever.\nDedicating interlude time to experimenting provides an opportunity for characters to develop new technology concepts. To perform an experiment a character needs to nominate an objective and identify two Intelligence focuses that will underpin the experiment. In each interlude shift spent experimenting, the character will roll a challenge test against each of these focuses. If both tests pass, then both drama dice values get added to their progress. The TN and ST of the experiment will be determined by the GM taking into account the number of breakthroughs required to move for the current technology to the character's objective.\nKinaesthetic Discipline®\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs desired\n\nEffect\nAccrue dexterity bonuses\n\nFocus\nDexterity\n\nMuscle mass and bone density are not the only things that degrade in zero/low-g environment. Reflexes and fine motor skills also atrophy. Recently the Ganymede Institute of Agronomics and Applied Sciences (GIAAS) developed Kinaesthetic Discipline®, a series of exercises and simulations that prevent and even reverse this atrophy. The naïve academics decided to post the research royalty-free into the feed before the corporations could get their hands on it. The lead author has subsequently disappeared.\nWhen a character dedicates an interlude shift to Kinaesthetic Discipline® they can accrue dexterity bonuses. These bonuses can be spent to boost a dexterity roll by +2. Once a bonus is spent it is gone.\nCharacters roll a straight dexterity skill test against TN 13. If they pass, the drama die is the number of dexterity bonuses they have accrued.\nA character may perform this activity once in an interlude.\nMental Conditioning\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs desired\n\nEffect\nAccrue willpower bonuses\n\nFocus\nWillpower\n\nMental Conditioning originated as a psychological resilience program developed during the early Mars terraforming initiatives, when isolation, high-risk labour, and limited resources demanded exceptional emotional control and cognitive stability. Initially formalized by Martian neuropsychologists and military trainers, it combined mindfulness protocols, cognitive reinforcement, and sensory deprivation drills to enhance focus, discipline, and resistance to panic under stress. Over time, the practice spread to long-haul freighter crews, Belter survivalists, and security contractors across the system, evolving into a diverse set of routines -- part science, part ritual -- used to train the mind against fear, fatigue, and coercion in the harsh vacuum of the Belt and beyond.\nWhen a character dedicates an interlude shift to mental conditioning they can accrue willpower bonuses. These bonuses can be spent to boost a willpower roll by +2. Once a bonus is spent it is gone.\nCharacters roll a straight willpower skill test against TN 13. If they pass, the drama die is the number of willpower bonuses they have accrued.\nA character may perform this activity once in an interlude.\nRationing\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs needed\n\nEffect\nMitigates the loss of supplies\n\nFocus\nIntelligence\n\nWhile most ships in the system are provisioned with enough supplies for standard operations, unexpected events -- like damage to recycling systems, extended missions, blockades, or rerouted travel -- can radically shift anticipated needs. Spending Interlude time to implement rationing protocols reflects the crew’s proactive adaptation to scarcity, rather than reacting in crisis. It may involve recalibrating the water reclamation cycle, adjusting food distribution algorithms, or manually portioning breathable air in failing systems. This effort isn't just logistical -- it’s psychological, requiring coordination, trust, and mental resilience.\nCrew can mitigate the impacts of an unexpected drain on resources by dedicating interlude shifts to rationing.\nTo ration:\n\nThe GM will provide the TN reflective of the unexpected drain (eg. bad air scrubbers TN9, significant combat damage TN19)\nA character rolls a straight Intelligence test (+2 with a current audit)\n\nPass -&gt; supply loss has been mitigated\nFail -&gt; supply loss will have an impact sometime in the future (GM discretion)\n\nAdditional interlude shifts can be allocated to rationing, if the supply loss is not yet mitigated.\nRecovery\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nMinimum of one interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs needed\n\nEffect\nBasic test to remove condition or gain fortune\n\nFocus\nConstitution (Stamina) or Intelligence (Medicine)\n\nThe universe of The Expanse is a dangerous place, and it is easy for characters to accrue physical conditions. To permanently remove these conditions as character must dedicate time to recovery in an appropriate facility (eg. medical clinic, or ship med bay). Even those who have survived an encounter unscratched, may need to recover from it. A character can also use a recovery interlude shift to recover fortune.\nRemove conditions\nTo remove conditions characters must make an advanced Constitution (Stamina) TN 11 test every interlude shift.\n\nIf the character is under medical care, a physician or an auto-doc (+2) can make an Intelligence (Medicine) test against the same TN, and you can use the better of the two rolls.\nTrack the result of the Drama Die for each successful test.\nOnce you reach a success threshold of 5, you can remove an injured condition.\n\nCondition\nRelevant Ability Test\nSuccess Threshold\nSpecial Notes\n\nInjured\nIntelligence (Medicine) or Constitution (Stamina)\n5\nMinor injury; quick rest or simple treatment often enough.\n\nWounded\nIntelligence (Medicine) or Constitution (Stamina)\n15\nRequires medical bay or extended care.\n\nFatigued\nConstitution (Stamina) or Willpower (Self-Discipline)\n4\nNo special equipment required\n\nExhausted\nConstitution (Stamina) or Willpower (Self-Discipline)\n10\nExtended rest or focused recovery needed.\n\nBlinded\nIntelligence (Medicine) or Constitution (Stamina)\n12\nOnly if temporary; permanent cases require prosthetic/augment.\n\nDeafened\nIntelligence (Medicine) or Constitution (Stamina)\n9\nOnly if temporary; permanent cases require prosthetic/augment.\n\nUnconscious\nIntelligence (Medicine) must be another character\n3\nStabilizes and awakens; failure: remain unconscious.\n\nDying\nIntelligence (Medicine) must be another character\n3\nOn success, character is stabilised and becomes Wounded, Unconscious and Exhausted\n\nRecovering fortune\nIf a character is recovering fortune, they can do so be dedicating a interlude shift to rest and recreation. They do not need any special facilities to do this. This recovery interlude can only be used to regain fortune and cannot be undertaken whilst the character is injured, wounded, fatigued, exhausted, unconscious or dying. Characters regain fortune at a rate of 10 + character level per interlude shift.\nRelating\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nMinimum of one interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs needed\n\nEffect\nBuild bonds between characters\n\nFocus\nN/A\n\nIn the vast, isolating expanse of space, relationships are as critical to survival as oxygen and fuel. A crew that trusts one another can coordinate under fire, make tough calls without hesitation, and hold the line when systems fail or plans go sideways. In a setting where political tensions, corporate exploitation, and environmental fragility press in from all sides, strong personal bonds offer stability, loyalty, and emotional resilience. Building relations during Interludes isn’t just about friendship -- it’s a strategic choice that can defuse conflict, improve cooperation, and create lasting ties that influence future encounters, negotiations, or even loyalty in mutinous moments. A bonded crew acts as a single unit; a divided one tears itself apart in the cold dark.\nIf two characters spend an relating interlude shift with each other, they strengthen the bond intensity between them. The number of shifts required is the target bond intensity. For example, to move a bond from intensity 2 to 3, will require 3 shifts. No roll is required, but the type of relating can change the type of bond\nReputation Maintenance\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nPossibly one interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nOnce a week\n\nEffect\nBasic test to remove condition or gain fortune\n\nFocus\nCommunication (Expression, Performance or Deception)\n\nIn the fractured and often lawless landscape of the solar system, reputation is currency. With no central authority truly binding Earth, Mars, and the Belt, deals are made and broken on the strength of a name. A ship’s reputation can open locked docking bays, secure last-minute fuel, or scare off would-be pirates. For individuals, reputation shapes how factions, fixers, and station bosses treat you -- whether they offer you work, watch your back, or put a target on it. It precedes you in places you've never set foot, serving as both shield and sword in political dealings, street-level negotiations, and black-market exchanges. In The Expanse, where trust is rare and betrayal is common, reputation determines who survives the long haul -- and who gets spaced when no one’s watching.\nIf, within the last week, a character has relied upon their reputation, or acted in line with their reputation, in a way that word can spread, their reputation is maintained. Failing that a character can use a interlude shift to maintain their reputation spread. Similarly they can use a interlude shift to bolster or diminish their reputation spread. This often involves making their actions known or a denying their actions through media, such as interviews or broadcasting videos.\nTo maintain a reputation spread, characters need to dedicate one interlude shift and roll a TN11 Communication (Expression, Performance or Deception) ability test.\nTo bolster or diminish their reputation by one spread point they will need to dedicate one interlude shift and roll a TN13 Communication (Expression, Performance or Deception) ability test.\nTo create a reputation anew a character will need to highlight an appropriate behaviour in the previous week, and then dedicate one interlude shift and roll a TN15 Communication (Expression, Performance or Deception) ability test.\nResearching\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs desired\n\nEffect\nRoll 4 advanced researh\n\nFocus\nIntelligence (Research) or other relevant focuis\n\nResearching leads is how a smart crew stays ahead of the game in a system built on secrets, shifting alliances, and hidden agendas. Whether tracking down a missing freighter, verifying a shady cargo contract, or digging into a name whispered on backchannels, research turns rumours into actionable intel. In a world where stations lie, manifests are forged, and faction loyalties change with the burn cycle, blindly charging in is a shortcut to an airlock funeral. Digging into comm records, sifting through public data nets, bribing info brokers, or scraping old sensor logs during an Interlude gives the crew time to connect dots others miss. It turns scattered clues into solid direction, reveals hidden dangers, and sometimes exposes a deeper plot. In the Expanse, information isn’t just power -- it’s survival, profit, and leverage.\nDuring the campaign characters will come across many leads. Some of these leads will point to future missions, and some will turn out to be dead ends. Character can dedicate interlude shifts to researching these leads.\nAll leads research are normally research advance tests, but characters can use other focuses where appropriate. The GM will provide the TN and the ST for the test. Characters can roll four times during each interlude shift.\nShip Maintenance\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nOnce per week per system\n\nEffect\nPrevent the accrual of loss conditions\n\nFocus\nN/A\n\nShip maintenance is the difference between life and death in the vacuum of space. Every ship, from a Martian corvette to a Belter junk-hauler, is a self-contained ecosystem -- housing life support, propulsion, power, and environmental controls in a fragile, complex balance. Microfractures in a bulkhead, fouled scrubbers, a lagging thrust vector -- all of these can cascade into catastrophic failure if left unchecked. In the Belt especially, where replacement parts are scarce and station mechanics might not be trustworthy, routine maintenance becomes a sacred ritual. A well-maintained ship is faster, safer, and more efficient; it burns less fuel, resists radiation better, and holds together under stress. Crews who respect their vessel treat it like a living thing -- monitoring her sounds, smells, and quirks -- because in the black, your ship isn’t just your ride; it’s your only shelter, your last line of defence, and often, your only home.\nA spaceship has four distinct systems that need to be maintained:\n\nHull and structure\nManoeuvrability systems -- includes thrusters and the Epstein drive\nSensor systems -- including computer systems\nWeapon systems -- torpedoes, railguns, PDCs and grapplers\n\nFailure to maintain systems\nIf a ships systems have not been maintain in the past week, then the player has to roll on each system that has not been maintained. If they roll a 1 2 or 3, the ship will accrue a Faulty System flaw for that system. This flaw will be removed by it's next maintenance. The number of dice rolled is equal to the number of weeks it has been without maintenance (ie. after two weeks without maintenance, roll two dice).\nSituational Awareness Simulations\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs desired\n\nEffect\nAccrue perception bonuses\n\nFocus\nPerception\n\nSituational Awareness Simulations were first developed by the Martian Congressional Republic Navy during the early terraforming era, when operating in low-visibility, high-risk environments demanded rapid threat recognition and spatial comprehension under extreme stress. These training protocols combined zero-g tactical exercises, sensor blinding drills, and multispectral threat identification into immersive VR suites aboard naval stations and fleet carriers. As piracy, boarding actions, and deep-space salvage operations became more common throughout the system, civilian security firms, Belter prospectors, and outer-system smugglers adapted the simulations into modular programs -- ranging from improvised drills in vac-sealed corridors to open-source VR patches -- making situational awareness a prized survival skill in the void.\nWhen a character dedicates an interlude shift to mental conditioning they can accrue perception bonuses. These bonuses can be spent to boost a perception roll by +2. Once a bonus is spent it is gone.\nCharacters roll a straight perception skill test against TN 13. If they pass, the drama die is the number of perception bonuses they have accrued.\nA character may perform this activity once in an interlude.\nSleep\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nOnce per day\n\nEffect\nPrevent loss of fortune and function\n\nFocus\nConstitution (Stamina)\n\nSleep is essential for survival in the harsh conditions of space -- not just for physical health, but for mental stability, decision-making, and crew cohesion. In microgravity environments and high-stress operations, the human body suffers disrupted circadian rhythms, reduced immune response, and deteriorating cognitive function. A tired crew makes mistakes: missed readings, delayed reactions, emotional outbursts. In combat, a split-second lapse can mean decompression or death. Regular, quality sleep helps regulate hormones, restore stamina, and maintain emotional balance -- vital when confined with others in tight, recycled-air quarters for months at a time. In The Expanse, where long burns, erratic schedules, and mission pressure are the norm, sleep isn’t a luxury -- it’s a strategic necessity. Crews that skip it too often burn out, break down, or turn on each other, becoming their own worst threat in the black.\nEvery character should allocate one interlude shift per day to sleep. This doesn't just represent sleep, it includes hygiene care and other 'personal' pursuits. If a character does not sleep, they following effect will occur\n\nDay\nEffect\n\n1st\n-5 fortune &amp; Constitution (Stamina) TN 15 to avoid condition\n\n2nd\n-10 fortune &amp; Constitution (Stamina) TN 15 to avoid condition\n\n3rd\n-15 fortune &amp; Constitution (Stamina) TN 15 to avoid condition\n\n4th\n-20 fortune + Unconscious condition\n\nCondition progression Normal -&gt; Fatigued -&gt; Exhausted -&gt; Unconscious\nStudy\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs desired\n\nEffect\nAccrue communication or intelligence bonuses\n\nFocus\nCommunication or Intelligence\n\nIn the resource-strained environments of the Belt and outer planets, formal education is rare, but study -- especially self-directed or apprentice-based learning -- remains a vital path to advancement. On stations and ships, knowledge is often passed through trade manuals, archived data partitions, or oral histories recorded in tightbeam journals. Studying these materials -- whether ancient Earth rhetorical texts, Martian engineering treatises, or pirate-patched training sims -- allows individuals to hone reasoning, refine speech, or gain technical mastery. Those who dedicate Interlude time to focused study can sharpen their Intelligence through structured logic and theory, or improve Communication by internalizing persuasive tactics, intercultural nuance, and leadership protocols -- skills critical for surviving negotiation, command, or deception in a fractured solar system.\nWhen a character dedicates an interlude shift to study they can accrue either communication or intelligence bonuses. They need to nominate which attribute they are focusing on at the beginning of the interlude shift. These bonuses can be spent to boost a communication or intelligence roll by +2. Once a bonus is spent it is gone.\nCharacters roll a straight communication or intelligence skill test against TN 13. If they pass, the drama die is the number of communication or intelligence bonuses they have accrued.\nA character may perform this activity twice in an interlude.\nTraining\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nOnce after level progression\n\nEffect\nEnables access to new focuses, talents, degrees, or specialisations\n\nFocus\nN/A\n\nTraining transforms a one-off event into a habit by embedding action into memory, reducing hesitation, and building automaticity. A single successful act -- like disarming a bomb, docking under pressure, or bluffing a hostile customs agent -- proves something is possible, but it doesn’t make it reliable. Through repetition, the brain forms stronger neural pathways, turning deliberate decisions into instinctive responses. In the hostile environments of The Expanse, where reaction time and consistency can mean the difference between docking and drifting, training ensures that what once required focus becomes second nature. It removes the uncertainty from high-risk actions and prepares the body and mind to act automatically, even under stress, fatigue, or fear. In other words, training turns experience into readiness -- and readiness into survival.\nWhen a character acquires new focuses, talents, degrees, or specialisations through a level progression, during the next interlude they need to dedicate one shift to training these new skills.\nUnarmed Combat Training\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs desired\n\nEffect\nAccrue fighting bonuses\n\nFocus\nFighting\n\nUnarmed Combat Training has deep roots across the system, from Martian Marine close-quarters protocols to Belt-born brawling techniques developed in tight corridors and zero-g. In confined environments where firearms can breach hull integrity or weapons are confiscated during inspections, the ability to neutralize threats with bare hands or improvised holds becomes essential. Martian instructors formalized it into gravity-variable martial arts programs, while Belter factions adapted it into fluid, fast-paced systems optimized for low-g grappling and rapid disarms. Crew members, smugglers, and security personnel train during Interludes to build muscle memory, improve coordination, and maintain combat readiness -- gaining mechanical benefits to close combat and increasing survivability in any scrap where bullets aren't an option.\nWhen a character dedicates an interlude shift to mental conditioning they can accrue fighting bonuses. These bonuses can be spent to boost a fighting roll by +2. Once a bonus is spent it is gone.\nCharacters roll a straight fighting skill test against TN 13. If they pass, the drama die is the number of fighting bonuses they have accrued.\nA character may perform this activity once in an interlude.\nWatch\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nThree times a day\n\nEffect\nObserve events on and around the ship\n\nFocus\nPerception (Hearing or Seeing)\n\nKeeping watch is a quiet but vital act of vigilance -- a shield against the complacency that kills in space, and a window into the unexpected. Even when the weapons rest and the crew goes about their interludes, danger doesn’t. Pirates, corporate enforcers, rogue AIs, or slow-leaking coolant lines don’t wait for anyone to be ready. A proper watch rotation ensures someone is always scanning the sensors, checking hull integrity, monitoring life support, or listening for whispers in the comms. But it’s not just about catching threats -- watch is often when the strange things surface: faint transponder echoes, anomalous debris patterns, old signals in forgotten bands. It maintains discipline, enforces routine, and gives the rest of the crew space to recover safely. Neglect it, and one quiet hour can turn into catastrophe. Keep it, and the ship stays a step ahead of the void -- and maybe catches a secret no one was meant to see.\nTo dedicate an interlude shift to the watch, a character must only engage in light activities that will not distract them from monitoring the sensors. Additionally, the character cannot be Fatigued or Exhausted. To determine the effectiveness of the watch, the character makes a basic Perception (Hearing or Seeing) test against the difficulty of observing an event.\nSince the character on watch is mostly relaxing, they also recover fortune at half the rate according to the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/diomedes-spear/rules/interludes/#recovery\">Interludes#Recovery</a> rules.\nWorkout\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs desired\n\nEffect\nAccrue constitution or strength bonuses\n\nFocus\nConstitution or Strength\n\nWorkouts -- structured physical training routines -- are essential for maintaining Stamina and Strength in the low-gravity environments of the Belt, stations, and ships, where muscle atrophy and bone loss are constant threats. From Martian military regimens conducted under artificial gravity to resistance-band drills used by Belters in narrow corridors, these routines are more than discipline -- they’re survival. Regular training improves Strength by reinforcing muscle mass and boosting explosive power, vital for handling gear, fighting in confined spaces, or brute-forcing machinery. Simultaneously, workouts enhance Stamina by expanding cardiovascular capacity and improving endurance in high-stress, oxygen-thin conditions.\nWhen a character dedicates an interlude shift to workout they can accrue either constitution or strength bonuses. They need to nominate which attribute they are focusing on at the beginning of the interlude shift. These bonuses can be spent to boost a constitution or strength roll by +2. Once a bonus is spent it is gone.\nCharacters roll a straight constitution or strength skill test against TN 13. If they pass, the drama die is the number of constitution or strength bonuses they have accrued.\nA character may perform this activity twice in an interlude.",

		"content": "Membership in The Expanse Roleplaying Game represents a character's formal connection to, and influence within, a large organisation. Unlike honorifics, which are titles reflecting a character's reputation that others react to, membership grants specific access and authority due to one's standing in a group.\nWhat it Represents\n\nMembership signifies a character's influence within an organisation.\nIt measures their connection to large groups of people.\nOrganisations can be diverse, ranging from governments (e.g., Martian Navy), corporations (e.g., Star Helix Security), media outlets, religious groups (e.g., The Mormons), to criminal syndicates (e.g., Golden Bough Society, Loca Greiga).\n\nHow Membership is Gained and Advanced\n\nCharacter Creation: Characters can start with membership based on their backgrounds or professions. It can also be a benefit from a character's chosen drive (specifically, a Rank 1 Membership increase).\nIn-Play Progression: Characters advance through the ranks of an organisation by being awarded a rank increase by the Game Master (GM).\nInterlude Activity: Once awarded, characters must spend an interlude performing the &quot;Advancement&quot; activity to solidify their new rank. This may require an advanced ability test, such as Communication, if the GM feels it necessary to &quot;close the deal&quot; and demonstrate the character's worthiness. The success threshold for this test is typically low (5-10).\nTalents: The Executive talent explicitly grants the character a Membership in a new organisation or advances their rank in an existing one.\n\nLevels/Ranks of Membership\nMembership is structured into three distinct ranks, each offering increasing benefits and responsibilities:\nRank 1: Recruit\n\nBonus: New recruits receive a +1 bonus to all rolls related to positive dealings within the organisation's ranks. This bonus can increase to +2 if the character already had good relations with the group.\nAccess: They gain access to the group's basic resources, such as provided services, shared credit accounts, company housing, or discounted professional services. Military and security organisations may provide access to equipment and weapons not available to civilians.\nStatus: Recruits are often tested and evaluated before being given greater trust or access. They typically know only their immediate superiors and fellow recruits. They are expected to prove themselves.\n\nRank 2: Respected Member\n\nBonus: After proving themselves, respected members gain a +2 bonus to any tests involving other members of their organisation at their rank or lower. They also receive a +1 bonus in social interactions with non-members who have reason to respect or fear their organisation.\nAccess: They gain access to their group's full organisational resources, which usually includes other personnel. They can command subordinates to perform easy encounters or use organisational resources to pay recruits to handle tasks of average difficulty. This extends to wealth, equipment, information, and access to high-ranking individuals with connections.\nExpectations: At this rank, members are expected to act in the group's best interests and not to waste resources on personal goals.\n\nRank 3: Authority Figure\n\nInfluence: This is the pinnacle of power within an organisation, often achieved only by those who founded the group.\nControl: Authority figures have full control over the group's priorities and actions. This control does not extend to what members think about the group, only what they must do to remain loyal.\nSocial Bonus: They gain an additional +1 bonus (for a total of +2) in social situations where their control of the group would impress non-members.\n\nImpact on Gameplay\n\nAccess to Jobs and Services: Membership can be a prerequisite for accessing military shipyards or for securing contracts with government or corporate clients.\nResource Management: An organisation's Economy rating can reduce the difficulty of Income tests for purchasing goods, with the character's Membership rank capping the maximum reduction. Membership can also be used towards payment for services, establishing credit, or securing discounts on repairs and maintenance for ships.\nSocial Dynamics: Membership influences how NPCs react to characters and can provide bonuses in social tests. Certain social stunts, like &quot;In Good Standing&quot; or &quot;Oozing Confidence,&quot; can leverage Membership benefits. The Journalist stunt &quot;Fourth Estate&quot; even allows for temporarily gaining a Membership rank when covering an organisation.\nNarrative: Disparate ranks among player characters or conflicts between organisations can create compelling roleplaying opportunities. The GM may also give Membership to important NPCs so they can participate in stunts that use these traits.",

The GM decides how an NPC feels about you based on that character’s motives and emotions.\nNPCs will never defy their most deeply held values or sacrifice their personal safety without an exceptional circumstance coming into play.\nDetermining Attitude\nRoll 3D6 plus following modifiers\n\nModifier\nDetails\n\nCommunication\nAdd the Communication ability score of the character taking the lead in making contact. If a Communication focus would apply to the first impression, add its bonus as well.\n\nReputation\nAdd +2 for a Reputation that would impress the NPC. Impose -2 for a Reputation that would offend the NPC.\n\nOther modifiers\nThe GM can add other modifiers to the roll based on the NPC’s known feelings and motives.\n\nThe take attitude from table below\n\nRoll\nAttitude\nModifier\nDescription\n\n&lt; 3\nVery Hostile\n-3\nThe very hostile NPC can barely contain their dislike, and is inclined to respond to contact with either violence or by leaving the characters’ presence. They may nurse a grudge and oppose the characters in the future. This is a rare spontaneous impression, and the GM should come up with a specific reason why any first impression would get a Very Hostile response.\n\n4-5\nHostile\n-2\nThe hostile NPC reacts to contact with ire, but might disguise this. They either refuse to provide help, or undermine the characters’ apparent interests.\n\n6-8\nStandoffish\n-1\nThe standoffish NPC would prefer that the characters just leave them alone. They either avoid the characters, ignore them, or firmly ask interlopers to go away.\n\n9-11\nNeutral\n+0\nThe neutral NPC hasn’t decided things either way about characters making contact, and responds with cool caution, bored disinterest, or polite detachment, depending on their personality.\n\n12-14\nOpen\n+1\nThe open NPC is curious or inclined to listen to the characters, and reacts appropriately based on their own motives and interests. Things could go either way. A negative variation of Open is Cowed, where the NPC is a bit afraid of what the characters might do if they don’t act receptive. Once the threat appears to be gone, the NPC becomes Standoffish.\n\n15-17\nFriendly\n+2\nThe friendly NPC takes a shine to characters making contact and is inclined to help them, but hesitates to provide any assistance that could cause them problems. A negative variation of Friendly is Shaken, where the NPC provides assistance out of fear. Once the threat appears to be gone, the NPC becomes Hostile.\n\n18+\nVery Friendly\n+3\nThe very friendly NPC is exceptionally welcoming, and provides gestures of respect or hospitality without being prompted. The NPC may provide extraordinary help, though nothing that contradicts their values. This is a rare spontaneous impression, and the GM should come up with a specific reason why any first impression would get a Very Friendly response. A negative variation of Very Friendly is Terrified, where the NPC anxiously does anything possible to avoid a perceived (or very real) threat. Once the threat is gone and the NPC feels safe, their attitude shifts to Very Hostile.\n\nInteractions\nSimple Social Interactions\nCommunication test vs NPC Willpower\nDetailed Social Interactions\nGoal is to change an NPC’s attitude to one where they feel inclined to do something in your favour.\nSocial Combat\nDetermine shifts required:\n\nDecide NPC’s current attitude, and the attitude required to comply with your wishes.\nNote number of shifts to move along character\nAdd 1 shift to focus the NPC’s attention toward doing what you wish\nCan add 1 or 2 shifts to represent the NPC’s greater resistance to your efforts if the desired actions would inconvenience or trouble them in some way\n\nShifts can be achieved through:\n\nSocial manoeuvres:\n\nEach shift becomes an action\nCan be opposed tests or tasks to complete\nClear additional shifts first\nUtterly failing -&gt; may set back progress by one or more shifts\n\nGrand gesture:\n\nperform a single ambitious gesture intended to influence the NPC in one fell swoop\nadvanced test -&gt; 3-5 x number of shifts\nachieving threshold -&gt; success, falling short -&gt; nothing",

To do so, they declare the intended stunt(s) and make a TN 13 Intelligence (Tactics) test. On success, they store 2 SP—or the drama die result if doubles are rolled—for future use.Banked SP cannot be used in the same round and must be spent in a later round. A commander may repeat the test in later rounds to accumulate enough SP for the declared stunt(s).Planning must target a specific stunt cost and cannot be used to simply enhance stunts like Guidance or Evasive Action.\n\nShip Command Stunts\n\nSP\nStunt\nDetails\n\n1+\nGuidance\n+1 bonus to chosen ship combat test this round.Choose from:- manoeuvre test- electronic warfare test- evasion test- point defence test- damage control test\n\n1+\nBlinding Manoeuvre\nReduces an opposing ship’s Sensors score by 1 (to a minimum score of –2) until the start of the next round.\n\n2\nMulti-targeting\nPBCs can both attack and defend this round without any penalty.\n\n2\nDown With the Ship\nIn an act of heroism, the commander can expend their own Fortune to remove damage taken by other characters (as the result of a Collateral Loss) on board the ship.\n\n2\nFollow the Leader\nAt close range, you tail another ship, mirroring its movements.- +2 to evasion against all ships except the one you're following- You gain any cover the lead ship enters- Remain in position unless the lead ship wins an opposed Dexterity (Piloting) test\n\n2+\nOn-target\nIncreases the TN of tests to evade your ship’s weapon attacks that round by +1.\n\n2+\nTactics\nIncreases the TN of an opposing ship commander’s next command test by +1.\n\n3\nPerceived weakness\nYou increase the damage of one successful weapon attack by 1d6.\n\n3+\nEvasive Action\nGrants a +1d6 Hull bonus to your ship that round for resisting damage from successful weapon attacks.\n\n3\nExploitable Terrain\nIf near exploitable terrain (e.g. asteroids, dust cloud), you identify a path offering cover. Immediately trigger either the Evasive Manoeuvre or Follow the Leader stunt.\n\n3+\nCalculation\nYou can bank the SP you just spent for this stunt +1 and use them on a later stunt. You can also combine these SP with future SP earned.\n\n4\nPrecise hit\nOne successful weapon attacks results in an additional Loss, even if the target’s Hull completely eliminated the damage\n\n4\nSkimming\nA ship near a planet with an atmosphere can attempt to evade pursuit by diving into it. The pilot makes an opposed TN 17 Dexterity (Piloting) test. On success, the pursuing ship loses track of the target.On subsequent rounds, the pursuer may attempt opposed TN 11 Intelligence (Technology) + Sensors tests to reacquire the target.\n\n4\nToo Close\nThis stunt can be used when engaged with multiple enemies and adjacent to a ship (or station) at least one size class larger.The pilot attempts to position the ship so that attacking it risks hitting the larger vessel. During the Manoeuvre phase, make an opposed TN 15 Dexterity (Piloting) test against the larger ship, with a –2 penalty. Reduce the TN by 1 for each additional size class difference.- Success: +2 to evasion against all ships except the one used for cover.- Drama Die 5–6 on a missed attack: The larger ship is hit instead.- Both pilots fail: The ships collide—2d6 damage to the larger ship, 4d6 to the smaller.\n\n4+\nSet-up\nYou force an enemy ship into a nearby hazard (e.g. debris, short-range weapon, asteroid).This counts as a weapon attack dealing damage equal to half the SP spent (rounded down).The target may evade with a TN equal to: 10 + your Intelligence + Leadership (if any) + ½ SP spent.\n\n5\nBurn Them\nAt extremely close range (under 1 km), you can use your Epstein drive as a weapon by flipping and burning toward an enemy ship.Make an opposed TN 19 Dexterity (Piloting) test at –2.- Success: The enemy is caught in your drive plume, taking 6d6 damage. - Failure: No damage is dealt, but penalties still apply. During the manoeuvre:- Only rear-facing weapons can fire. - Enemies gain +2 to evasion against your attacks.- Your ship suffers –2 to all evasion tests.\n\n5\nWeapon Online\nA crew member can temporarily restore a damaged or depleted weapon.Make a TN 14 Intelligence (Engineering) or Dexterity (Gunnery) test. Success: The weapon functions for 1d3 shots, then fails permanently until full maintenance is performed at a spaceport.\n\n6\nQuick Start\nThe crew can attempt to make a quick repair and restart the ship’s reactor.This requires two characters to work together; one must make a TN 14 Intelligence (Technology) test and another must make a TN 14 Intelligence (Engineering) test, and they must reach a threshold of 15.\n\n7\nMisdirect\nYou attempt to redirect an incoming torpedo toward a nearby ship by performing a close-range flip and burn.Requires:- An opposed Dexterity (Piloting) test against the nearby ship- A TN 17 Intelligence (Technology) test by another crew memberSuccess on both: The torpedo strikes the other ship instead.\n\nFleet Command Stunts\n\nSP\nStunt\nDetails\n\n1+\nCombined Fire\nYou coordinate fire with an allied ship, increasing the likelihood that both of you hit the target.

The loss of Hull rating lasts until repaired.\n\n4+\nSkewer\nYour attack is in just the right place to do serious damage inside the vehicle. One character suffers 4d6 damage for 4 SP, or for 6 SP, 6d6 damage.\n\n5\nRupture\nYour attack ruptures a fuel line or power conduit, causing an internal explosion. This deals 3d6 penetrating damage to crew in a compartment. It also causes the effects of a System Damage (3 SP)\n\nStep 6: Damage Control\n\n[!todo] Steps\n\nChoose action (one per character performing damage control)\nPerform damage control roll\nSpend SP if applicable\n\nAction\nDetails\n\nStep 6: Damage Control\n\nDamage control roll\nLoss off Manoeuvrability, Sensors, or Weapons can be eliminated with a damage control advanced test:- Intelligence (Engineering) vs. TN 11- success threshold is 5 for every loss on that system\n\nRestore offline reactor or weapons\nTemporarily restore offline system- TN 13 basic Intelligence (Engineering) test- restores system for a number of rounds equal to the Drama Die\n\nDamage Control Stunts\n\nSP\nStunt\nDetails\n\n1+\nNot My Ship!\nThe Engineer can spend Fortune to reduce damage taken by the ship just as it were part of the hull.

If the crew does not meet the min, add a -2 modifier for each category drop.\nCrew Competence\nFor ships crew by NPCs, ability test bonuses are determined by the crew competence.\n\nCompetence\nBonus\n\nIncompetent\n0\n\nPoor\n1\n\nAverage\n2\n\nCapable\n3\n\nSkilled\n4\n\nElite\n5\n\nDrive\nEven at a high-g burn, regular breaks must be taken for the crew to attend to their biological needs and recover, which means that ships must have stores of food, water, air, medicine, and other consumables in proportion to the crew and the distance the ship plans to travel.\nAn Epstein Drive plume is visible and detectable over a considerable distance, meaning a ship on the burn is fairly easy to track.\nThe plume itself is capable of reducing any matter in it down to its constituent atoms, and firing a drive in close proximity to a station, an asteroid, or another ship can cause considerable damage.\nSensors\nA ship’s Sensors score measures the overall effectiveness of this equipment, on a range from –2 to 6 or more.\nWeapons\nWhile civilian ships are unarmed, military and security craft have a variety of weapons, as do some pirates and similar illegal ships.\nTypes of weapons:\n\nGrapplers\nPoint defence cannons (PBCs)\nRail Guns\nTorpedoes\n\nCountermeasures\nMost ships also have defensive countermeasures packages used to help keep enemies from targeting them:\n\nCommunications arrays can broadcast cycling bursts of radio static across commonly used frequencies to jam communications, and at close enough range\nCommunications lasers can be used to try and blind enemy targeting optics\nPhysical chaff can be ejected into space between the ship and enemies, spreading out clutter to interfere with targeting lasers or radar.\n\nQualities and flaws\nQualities\n\nQuality\nEffect\n\nAcceleration, Improved\nThe ship can accelerate faster. When performing a high-g maneuver, the ship can add a bonus of up to +7. The ship also gets a +1 to the Piloting test when attempting to increase or decrease range. Additional applications of this bonus can be taken, which increases the high-g maneuver bonus by 1 for each, up to a maximum of +9. Each additional level also grants another +1 to the Piloting test to increase range, up to a maximum of +3.\n\nAdvanced Sensor Package\n+1 increase in Sensors score for each time this quality is applied.Sensors score usually maxes out at 6, unless the GM chooses to make an exception.\n\nAgile\nOnly ships of Small or Medium size can take this quality. The ship is extremely nimble and able to maneuver easier than other ships. The ship gets a +1 to Evasion tests and any other Piloting tests that require maneuverability. Additional applications can be taking which grant an additional +1 up to a maximum of +3. A ship must be designed and built to have this capability. It cannot be added later.\n\nAltered Transponder Code\nThe ship has access to or use of an altered transponder code, allowing it to appear as another ship with a different name and point of origin. This can provide a way around any number of prob lems that might arise in the course of a vessel’s life. It should be noted that changing a transponder code is highly illegal. MCRN ships are designed as such so that if the transponder code is altered without the proper access codes the ship self-destructs.\n\nAtmosphere Capable\nThe ship can operate in a planetary atmosphere for limited periods of time and is capable of landing. Generally, a ship must be designed and built to have this capability. It cannot be added later.\n\nCommunication Systems, Advanced\nThe ship’s communications systems, both tightbeam and radio array, have an increased bandwidth that results in shorter relay times, although lightspeed still dictates the minimum transmis sion time of interplanetary communications. The advanced communications system can also send and receive encrypted messages and provide a private network for all inbound and outbound comm traffic. It can even break through some jamming frequencies. Flagships often have advanced communications systems so that they can better organize attacks. The SP cost for any Fleet Command Stunts is reduced by 1.\n\nDisguise\nThe ship has been disguised in some way to conceal its true provenance or purpose. While not as effec tive as stealth, Disguise combined with an Altered Transponder Code, may allow a ship to pass inspection if those looking don’t know what they’re looking for. This can counter the Wanted flaw (see the Spaceships chapter of The Expanse RPG) or similar difficulties but is not meant as a permanent solution to either.\n\nDrone Bay\nThe ship has at least two drones for combat, visual reconnaissance, or repair. These can be remote controlled by crewmembers who can pilot them or by a computer system.\n\nEmergency Batteries\nAll ships have batteries that allow them to run life support and maneuvering thrusters (although not the Epstein drive) even when the engines are offline for a limited period—usually less than a week depending how much power is used. Emergency batteries allow a ship to operate for months without reactor power.\n\nFlagship\nFlagships are the leaders to fleets and are often on the front line and the hub of command and communi cations in battle. During the Command step of space combat, the flagship generates an additional 2 SP and can give any of their generated SP to allied ships. This SP is added to any SP generated by that ship during its Command step.\n\nGood Juice\n+2 bonus on Constitution (Stamina) tests against high-acceleration manoeuvres.\n\nGourmet Galley\nThe ship has an extensive galley capable of turning out extravagant meals that are well-balanced and nutritious, and nutritious. It also has a high-quality coffee (and beverage) maker that makes a cup of coffee as good as any found on Earth. The crew has a +1 bonus to a Constitution or Willpower test once per session when they have regular access. Maintaining this quality requires adding +1 to the Resupply Cost to maintain the ship (see Resupply in Chapter 1 of this book). The crew can eliminate this cost by losing this quality.\n\nHanger Bay\nCarrying ships totalling up to three or more Size categories smaller than it. Contains all of the necessary equipment for maintenance.\n\nHidden Compartments\nDesigned for smuggling or otherwise concealing cargo from inspections or borders.\n\nHull Platting\n+1 bonus when determining its Hull total against damage. Have multiple times, up to a maximum equal to its Hull score in dice.\n\nImproved Stores\nCapable of stocking supplies for extended travel for its crew and a number of passengers equal to half its optimal crew listing.\n\nLuxury Amenities\nEspecially fine or luxurious accommodations.Adds +1 to the Lifestyle Cost to maintain the shipContributes to reputations\n\nManoeuvrable\nConsidered one Size category smaller than its actual Size for tests to change range, to evade attacks, and for chases. Highly Manoeuvrable -&gt; effectively two Size categories smaller.\n\nMedical Expert System\nauto doc provides treatment character with the Intelligence (Medicine) focus with a +2 bonus. Additional applications -&gt; +1 bonus per option to a maximum of +5.\n\nNetwork and Database Access, Improved\nIn addition to the public access databases and local networks, the ship has improved and private access to more advanced stores and databanks of information. Using this terminal can give a +1 bonus to any advanced Intelligence (Current Affairs or Research) test made on board.\n\nPlasma Torpedoes\nThe ship must have a Torpedo Launcher. The ship is equipped with plasma torpedoes, designed to burn through hulls and inflict focused damage. The torpedo does 4d6 damage, and when a 1 or 2 is rolled for damage, it is counted as a 3.\n\nRail Gun, High-Charge\nThe ship must be at least Large Size. These rail guns fire with a higher thrust than stan dard issue rail guns, and the slugs are supercharged to do extra damage when they impact with hulls. The rail gun does 3d6 damage, but when a 1 or 2 is rolled for damage, it is counted as a 3.\n\nRapid Reload Torpedo Tubes\nThe ship can reload torpedoes at a faster than normal rate. SP cost to use the Rapid Reload Command Stunt is reduced by 1.\n\nReduced Crew Requirements\nThe ship has optimized controls to allow it to be manned by a smaller crew. Halve the crew requirement for the ship (with a minimum of 1)\n\nReliable\nThe ship is particularly dependable: it works the way it’s supposed to when its crew needs it to, and its upkeep is minimal. Though the crew still must dedicate activities to Maintenance during Interludes, the GM should reduce the Resupply Cost of maintaining the ship by 2.\n\nRedundant Hull (Double)\nA double hull provides a redundant barrier against the vacuum—usually by a few to several feet—in case the outer hull is damaged. This is standard on most Martian military ships. The ship can ignore the f irst loss condition imposed in an encounter. See Losses in the Spaceships chapter of The Expanse RPG.\n\nRedundant Hull (Triple)\nFor maximum redundancy, the ship has a triple hull design. Less common than the Double Hull, this is primarily a feature of the yachts of the obscenely wealthy. The ship can ignore the first two loss conditions imposed in an encounter. See Losses under Space Combat in the Spaceships chapter of The Expanse RPG.\n\nRepair Facilities\nThe ship has built-in facilities that can repair damage taken to other ships. Most standard losses can be repaired by a ship with repair facilities. To be able to repair serious losses, the ship must also have the Hanger Bay Quality and the ship to be repaired must be able to fit into the hanger bay.\n\nSecurity Systems, Advanced\nThe ship’s security systems and associated software are technologically advanced, providing a +1 bonus to crew Security or Technology tests involving the ship. Additional applications of this quality provide the crew with an additional +1 bonus per option, to a maximum of +5.\n\nSelf-destruct system\nProgrammed to drop the containment on the ship’s fusion reactor. Countdown or a dead-man’s switch\n\nSensor Scrambling\nWhen an enemy is within Medium or closer range, they suffer -1 to all Sensors tests.\n\nStealth\nWhile the ship is at rest, with its drive inactive and using only passive sensors, it is effectively invisible and undetectable to ship sensors.\n\nStealth, Improved\nProtogen stealth technology is more advanced than anything currently used by the UNN and the MCRN. Not only is this ship completely invisible to sensors when its engines are shut off, but heat sinks and other advanced technology make this ship harder to target, giving all enemy ships a -2 to all Electronic Warfare tests.\n\nSturdy\nThe ship is well built and can take more damage than expected for a ship of its size. The Hull receives a +2 to its value: for example, a Sturdy Large frigate would have a Hull score of 2d6+2 rather than the usual 2d6. A ship must be designed and built to have this capability. It cannot be added later.\n\nTargeting Systems, Advanced\nThe ship has a +1 bonus to the Sensors score for Electronic Warfare tests.\n\nUltraluxury Amenities\nThe ship is an ultraluxury vessel with accommodations that would not be out of place in any seven-star resort—full decks given over to sumptuously decorated quarters with staffed galleys, private baths, and lounges—all the best money can buy. And it does cost money: this quality adds +4 to the Resupply Cost to maintain the ship (see the Resupply Cost table in Chapter 1 of this book). The crew can eliminate the increase to Cost by losing this quality, but the ship will not function as it is meant to; it would be somewhat like trying to run a fancy hotel without a staff.\n\nWeapons - PBCs\nOne quality -&gt; cover to forward arcTwo qualities -&gt; full coverage\n\nWeapons - Rail Gun\nMust be at least Medium-sizedSpinal-mounted -&gt; forward or rear firing positionLarge or larger ships -&gt; two rail guns (one in each direction)Gigantic or larger ship -&gt; rail guns on turrets half-spherical range of fire on one side of the ship.\n\nWeapons - Torpedo Launcher\nMedium-sized -&gt; 1 torpedo launcherAdditional Size category -&gt; adds capacity for one launcher\n\nFlaws\n\nFlaw\nEffect\n\nAging\nThe ship is still in good shape but getting older, so it requires extra work to keep flying at its best. The GM should require additional Maintenance, Researching, and/or Fixing activities during Interludes (see Interludes in Chapter 5: Game Play of The Expanse RPG) and increase the Resupply Cost of by +1 to represent the additional mate rials needed for minor upkeep and repairs.\n\nBad Juice\n–1 penalty to Constitution tests involving acceleration hazards.\n\nBanned from Port\nThe ship has been banned from a major port for some reason—warranted or unwarranted. It could be due to substandard maintenance, disturbing the peace, or worse. This flaw should be paired with a specific port in Sol System and can be picked up during gameplay at GM’s discretion.\n\nFaulty System\nThe first use of the system in an encounter roll a die: - 1 or 2 -&gt; system stops working, just like a loss due to damage.\n\nFragile\nReduce its Hull score to that of the Size category one below the ship’s Size.\n\nHigh Maintenance\nRequire additional Maintenance activities and increase the Lifestyle Cost of maintaining the ship by +1.\n\nLimited Range\nThe ships does not carry enough reaction mass for long distance travel using its Epstein drive. Such ships usually have a range of about 1 AU (the distance of earth to the Sun or, roughly, earth to Mars and back).\n\nLumbering\nConsidered one Size category larger for manoeuvring tests.\n\nOld\nThe ship is old—between fifty years and a century’s service in space—and nothing works like it did when it was brand new. The GM should require additional Maintenance, Researching, and Fixing activities during Interludes (see Interludes in Chapter 5: Game Play of The Expanse RPG) and increase the Resupply Cost of by +2 to represent the additional materials needed for minor upkeep and repairs\n\nPoor Acceleration\nThe ship does not accelerate as fast as others of its Size. When performing a high-g manoeuvre, the ship can only add a bonus up to +5 (rather than the usual +6). The ship also suffers a -1 to the Piloting test when attempting to increase or decrease range. This Flaw can be taken up to six times, making the high-g manoeuvre bonus 0 and applying a -6 penalty to Piloting tests when attempting to increase or decrease range.\n\nPoor Amenities\nRecovering activities on board take 50% longer.\n\nSoftware Glitch\nThe ship has a glitch in the software that has been missed by updates and system scans, making it vulnerable to hacking. It is at a -1 penalty in all opposed Electronic Warfare tests (see Space Combat in the Spaceships chapter of The Expanse RPG for details)\n\nThrusters Only\nThe ship is only intended for short trips between planet and moon or station to station and not equipped with an Epstein drive. It limits the ship’s speed to up to 1 g until otherwise modified and takes a considerable amount of time to get up to this speed.\n\nUncomfortable\nCrewmembers find the ship’s space, furniture, and facilities inconvenient to use due to size constraints. Either these are too small, in the case of a pre-Belter era design, or too large, in the case of being designed specifically for Belters only, for some members of the crew. For applicable crewmembers, this will create a -1 penalty to all ship-related actions\n\nVulnerable Systems\nWhen the ship takes losses, choose an additional loss condition\n\nVulnerability\nThe ship has a weakness in the exterior (hull, hangar, cargo bay, etc.) that could be breached for boarding or worse. Anyone scanning the ship can make a TN 13 Intelligence (Technology) test to detect the weakness. Targeted weapon attacks that aim for the weakness impose a impose a -1 penalty to absorbing the Hull damage from that attack.\n\nWanted\nCan cause problems docking at legitimate ports, or might mean the ship needs to avoid certain places or routes in order to avoid further trouble.\n\nWeak Hull\nThe ship has a -1 penalty when determining the Hull total against damage. A ship can have this flaw multiple times, up a maximum equal to its Hull score in dice. For example, if the Hull is 3d6 the flaw can be taken three times.\n\nMaintenance and Upkeep\nGM should take the crew’s need to maintain their ship into account for maintenance activities during interludes, and remind players that neglecting these responsibilities may lead to the ship developing flaws or even suffering some losses, as if it were damaged.",

If you fail an Intelligence (Research) test, you can re-roll it, but must keep the result of the second roll.\n\nExpert\nYou have become adept at recalling relevant information. When you perform the A-Ha! stunt, you gain one free extra use of it; that is, if you spend 1 SP, you can perform the stunt twice, if you spend 2 SP, you can use it three times, and so on.\n\nMaster\nYour fact-finding abilities are unparalleled. When you make an Intelligence (Research) test as part of an advanced test, you gain a +1 bonus to the result of each Drama Die. This increases your total roll, and allows you to reach the success threshold faster.\n\nAce\nFew can fly like you do.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nDexterity 3 or higher and the Dexterity (Piloting) focus.\n\nNovice\nYou can coax more out of your ship than most. When you perform the Punch It chase stunt, you gain an extra +1 bonus on your next chase test, above the bonus gained for the stunt (so the bonus is +2 when you spend 1 SP, +3 when you spend 2 SP and so on).\n\nExpert\nAdd +2 to the Drama Die when making tests using the Dexterity (Piloting) focus.\n\nMaster\nYou are a peerless pilot. Add +1 to tests made using Dexterity (Piloting) and you may re-roll a failed test, although you don’t get the bonus on the re-roll and must take the result of the second roll.\n\nAgent\nYou’re a skilled spy and infiltrator.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nPerception 2 or higher and the Perception (Empathy) and Communication (Deception) focuses.\n\nNovice\nYou built your life on lies. If you fail a Communication (Deception) test, you can re-roll it, but must keep the result of the second roll.\n\nExpert\nYou are also adept at seeing through deception. When you use the Read the Room stunt, add +3 to your Perception (Empathy) roll when the stunt is opposed.\n\nMaster\nYou are a masterful spy. You gain two of the following focuses if you don’t have them already: Communication (Disguise), Communication (Investigation), Dexterity (Stealth), Intelligence (Cryptography), and Intelligence (Security). If you already have all of these, pick two and add +1 to all rolls made using them.\n\nBounty Hunter\nYou know how to find the right jobs, how to track down your target and get the job done with a minimum of fuss, and how to ensure you get paid before moving on to the next bounty.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nPerception 2 or higher and at least one Perception focus.\n\nNovice\nYou can designate someone or something as your “quarry” after spending at least an hour on the job investigating them, including reading a prepared brief or dossier. You can only have one active quarry at a time but can substitute a new quarry for a previous one with an additional time investment. Usually, your quarry is the focus of the bounty you’re currently pursuing. You’re considered to always have the tangential focus necessary to investigate your quarry, and if you have the primary or tangential focus, you gain a +1 bonus on your tests to investigate them. You also gain the benefits of the Dexterity (Initiative) and Perception (Intuition) focuses\n\nExpert\nYou can prepare a major action in relation to your quarry. Whenever you roll initiative against your quarry, you can perform your prepared action first before your quarry acts regardless of the initiative order; you then take your normal actions on your turn. Prepared actions may include things like a Run or Charge towards your quarry, an Attack against them, and attempt to hide from them, or a Stunt Attack directed at them. You can choose your prepared action up to when initiative is rolled. Once action time begins, however, it can’t be changed; you can either take the prepared action or choose not to—if circumstances allow.\n\nMaster\nWhen you surprise your quarry, you are automatically considered to have them dead-to-rights. You have a +2 bonus for any tests to see if you surprise your quarry. This is in addition to any bonuses from ability focuses or your Novice ability for this specialization. Also, if you fail an ability test to unlock a clue related to your quarry, you can re-roll the test and use the result of the second roll instead\n\nCommando\nYou are trained to fight, and to win, no matter the odds.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nConstitution 2 or higher and the Willpower (Self-Discipline) focus.\n\nNovice\nIf you fail a Constitution or Willpower (Self Discipline) test, you can re-roll, but must keep the result of the second roll.\n\nExpert\nYou know how to work with a team to get things done. At this degree, you gain an intensity 1 Relationship with your team, whoever that may be, and you keep the relationship even if the membership of your team changes. You can increase the intensity of this Relationship normally. See the Rewards chapter for details on Relationships.\n\nMaster\nYou can overcome the effects of some conditions through sheer grit. When you acquire the exhausted, fatigued, injured, or wounded conditions, make a TN 13 Constitution (Stamina) or Willpower (Self Discipline) test; if you succeed, you ignore the effects of the condition for the remainder of the encounter, although the condition itself remains.\n\nEntertainer\nIn a solar system containing billions of people, it’s possible for your voice to rise above the crowd—but what will you have to say if it does?\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nFocus in your area of influence with Attribute of 2 or higher\n\nNovice\nYou’ve got some raw potential, and you’re starting to learn how to experiment with it. Sometimes that blows up in your face, but sometimes it finds brilliance in what was otherwise an average work of art. Whenever you roll a test to create or perform art, you may choose to re-roll the attempt but must keep the new roll even if it’s worse. In addition, you should explain how a success transforms a performance that wasn’t going well or how a failure results in a promising piece going off the rails.\n\nExpert\nYou have developed a signature style, possibly even a signature piece such as a custom instrument or beloved persona, and it’s something with which audiences strongly connect. Talk to the GM to develop a clear idea of what this entails, but it should be fairly narrow— “making music” is not a valid signature since it could apply to almost any test for a musician, but “playing daggri-punk” or “my drag persona Miss Fifi Fofum” would both be acceptable since they are specific as to when they apply. Whenever you create using your signature, you can choose to either gain a +2 on the subsequent Income test or reduce the cost of Stunts while using it by 1 SP (minimum 1).\n\nMaster\nYour art is a part of you, and even those who aren’t familiar with your medium can tell right away that you have a gift for it. You make the most challenging artistic feats look easy and attempt things other artists can’t even dream of doing. Reduce the Test Difficulty by one category for all tests related to artistic creation and performance or by two categories if you can feature your signature. In addition, if the Drama Die is lower than 3 on a performance roll related to your art, treat it as though you rolled a 3 in terms of degrees of success. This can be further modified with the Right in the Feels Stunt.\n\nExecutive\nYou claim authority and leadership in an organization.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nCommunication 2 or higher and the Communication (Persuasion) focus.\n\nNovice\nYou have experience in negotiating the byways of your organization. You acquire a Membership in a new organization or advance to the next rank with an existing Membership (see the Rewards chapter for details on Memberships). You can re-roll any test to access privileges from, or influence members of, the organization behind this acquired or improved Member ship, but must keep the results of the second roll.\n\nExpert\nYour authority extends to calling in a subordinate to support you. Once per day you may make a Communication (Persuasion) test. If you succeed, you can call in a subordinate from the organization you chose at the Novice rank to aid you. Use one of the profiles found in the Threats chapter. If your character is level 5-8, this subordinate can be no more than a Minor threat, called at a test TN of 11. If your character is level 9-12, you may choose a Moderate-threat subordinate instead, at a test TN of 13. If your character is level 13 or above, you have the option of a subordinate who’s a Major threat in their own right, if you succeed at a TN 15 test. You do not gain the novice re-roll benefit on this test.\n\nMaster\nBecause you have influence in your organization, you have constant access to resources. Add your Membership rank in the organization to your Income whenever you can call upon your organization. Further more, if your Income score decreases, you regain the lost point during the next interlude when you interact with the organization.\n\nGunfighter\nNo one shoots as quickly or as accurately as you.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nDexterity 2 and Accuracy 2 or higher.\n\nNovice\nYour accuracy is instinctive. Pick Accuracy (Pistols) or Accuracy (Rifles). You gain a +1 to attack and damage rolls for attacks made using your chosen focus.\n\nExpert\nYou’re fast and precise. You may pick the other focus from the Novice degree and apply the Novice benefit to it, or improve the bonus for the focus you picked at Novice rank to +2 to your attack and damage rolls.\n\nMaster\nYou’re one with the gun. Choose one of the following stunts: Lightning Attack, Overwatch, Lethal Blow, or Wound. You can perform the chosen stunt for 1 SP less than usual when wielding a firearm. In the case of Overwatch, spending 1 SP gives you the effects of spending 2 SP, and spending 2 SP gives you the 3 SP effect. See Chapter 5 for details on these stunts.\n\nHacker\nYou excel at the use and abuse of computer systems.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nIntelligence 2 or higher and the Intelligence (Technology) focus.\n\nNovice\nYou are skilled in navigating computer systems. Add +1 to Intelligence (Technology) tests.\n\nExpert\nWhen things go wrong or don’t work quite how you want them to, you’re skilled in finding backdoors and loopholes. You can perform the High Tech Hustle stunt for 2 SP. In advanced tests involving computer systems, add +1 to your Drama Die roll. This increases your total test result and allows you to complete advanced tests faster.\n\nMaster\nBreaking into a system is one thing, but getting in and then out without getting caught is another. While using a computer system, you may perform the Cover Your Tracks stunt for 1 SP. Add another +1 to your Drama Die result while performing advanced tests for a total of +2, otherwise the same as the Expert degree benefit.\n\nInvestigator\nYou’re a skilled detective.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nPerception and Intelligence 2 or higher and least one Perception focus.\n\nNovice\nYou can always make a test to unlock a lead, even if you don’t have a primary or tangential focus relevant to the investigation, although you take a +2 increase in TN when you don’t have either (see Investigation in Chapter 5 for details). If you do have a primary or tangential focus for the lead, you get a +1 bonus to the test with a primary focus (in addition to the focus bonus) and no increase in TN for using a tangential focus.\n\nExpert\nThe real trick to being a great investigator isn’t finding clues, it’s knowing how to use them. You may use the Intuition stunt for 1 SP. Furthermore, if you have the primary focus required to unlock a lead, add another +1 to your roll to do so for a total of +2.\n\nMaster\nWhen all the evidence is gathered, you only need a flash of inspiration to put it together and find the solution. You can use the Breakthrough stunt on an investigation for only 3 SP.\n\nJournalist\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nBased on the type of journalism the character practices, they need either Communication 2 or higher and the Communication (Research) or Communication (Expression) focus, or Intelligence 2 or higher and the Intelligence (Research) or Intelligence (Current Affairs) focus. The GM has the final word on which requirement potentially applies\n\nNovice\nYou’ve learned to use your status as a journalist to get your foot in the door both literally and figuratively. Whenever you use the Press Pass stunt success fully to gain access to a situation, gain +2 to your next social test directly related to conducting journalistic activity.\n\nExpert\nYou’ve developed a few specific techniques as part of your journalistic arsenal. Select three stunts from the General Social Stunts list in The Expanse RPG— halve the SP cost of these stunts, rounded up (minimum 1). This reduction only applies when you’re using a stunt as part of your journalistic work; while they’re encouraged to give it a fair amount of latitude, the GM has the final say on whether it applies to a particular situation.\n\nMaster\nYou’ve got a knack for finding the right angle to make a story catch on and have developed enough of an audience following to get it started. Once per session, you may use the Go Viral stunt for free, provided you have some way of broadcasting the relevant events.\n\nMartial Artist\nYou are a master of hand-to-hand combat.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nFighting 2 or better and at least Novice rank in one hand-to-hand combat style\n\nNovice\nWhen you make a Fighting-based attack roll, add +1 to damage on a successful hit.\n\nExpert\nYou have excellent speed and timing. When you perform the Momentum stunt with SP gained from a Fighting attack roll, you gain a bonus to your initiative as if you spent one more SP than you have. So, if you spend 1 SP, you gain a +6 bonus to initiative; if you spend 2 SP, you gain a bonus of +9.\n\nMaster\nYou are a master of many close combat techniques. When you perform the Stunt Attack action with a Fighting attack roll, you automatically generate 2 SP.\n\nMechanic\nShe takes of you, you take care of her. You are at one with your ship in a way that makes other feel uncomfortable.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nIntelligence 2 or higher and Engineering Focus\n\nNovice\nNominate a ship as &quot;Your Ship&quot;. You have the Intuition focus, for the purposes of identifying if anything is wrong with your ship.\n\nExpert\nYou have worked on so many different systems, that you intuitively know how they work. Your Intuition focus can extend to any mechanical system.\n\nMaster\nRedundancy is the key. You have added extra redundancies to all of your ship's systems. When applying loss conditions from space combat, a roll of on the normal loss table, results in no loss rather than a reroll.\n\nPirate\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nCommunication 2 or higher.\n\nNovice\nYour past deeds have become known and your symbols, be they flags, songs, or catchphrases, herald your impending approach. You gain the Intimidation focus and can use your Communication rather than Strength Ability for tests that use it.\n\nExpert\nYour name is recognized in the far corners of the system and beyond the Ring gate. While people may not always fear you, they certainly respect you both as a celebrity and a known criminal. You gain +2 to all tests to identify prize ships in social situations and +2 to recruit new crew members.\n\nMaster\nWhether through economic disruption, tales of your derring-do, or by atrocities you’ve committed, it’s hard to go anywhere you aren’t known. While it’s harder to keep a low profile, there are distinct financial benefits to your notoriety. You gain a +2 to all tests to sell stolen cargo.\n\nScout\nYou’re skilled at understanding an area of space and finding what you’re looking for.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nIntelligence 2 or higher and the Intelligence (Navigation) focus.\n\nNovice\nYou are adept at making the most of your instruments when looking for something. If you fail an Intelligence (Technology) test when using sensors, you can re-roll it but must keep the result of the second roll.\n\nExpert\nYour astronomical abilities are unrivalled. When you make an Intelligence (Navigation) test as part of an advanced test, you gain a +1 bonus to the result of each Drama Die. This increases your total roll and allows you to reach the success threshold faster.\n\nMaster\nWhen you perform tests using ship sensors, treat them as if their Sensors rating is 1 higher.\n\nSniper\nYou are a crack shot.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nAccuracy 3 or better and the Accuracy (Rifles) focus.\n\nNovice\nYou know how to quietly set up a decisive shot. If you’re hidden from your target, you can re-roll your first Accuracy (Rifles) attack during an encounter, but must keep the results of the second roll.\n\nExpert\nYou know how to wait for a perfect shot to present itself. If you use the Aim action for an Accuracy (Rifles) attack, add a bonus to damage equal to the attack roll bonus your Aim provides. This includes any bonus from the Precision Marksmanship stunt.\n\nMaster\nYou are a deadly shot. When you are using the Accuracy (Rifles) focus, you can perform the Called Shot stunt for 2 SP.\n\nSmuggler\nYou move secret, illegal, illicit, or profitable cargo across contested or monitored borders.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nCommunication 2 or higher and the Communication (Bargaining) focus.\n\nNovice\nYou know how to mitigate risks and maximize profits. Add +1 to all tests where the TN was increased by Risk.\n\nExpert\nWhenever you acquire cargo, whether by using the Merchants Buying rules in Sol System or by using the clients in Trades of the Expanse: Trader/Smuggler, you may choose to also take on a small amount of illicit cargo. Your overall flight gains +1 Risk, but if you complete the trade successfully you gain an additional +2 Temporary Income bonus.\n\nMaster\nWhen you attempt to bribe somebody with an Income test or a Communication (Bargaining) test, you may spend one Temporary Income to re-roll it, but must keep the result of the second roll\n\nSocialite\nYou know people, and how to get what you want from them.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nCommunication and Perception 2 or higher.\n\nNovice\nYour natural charm causes people to like you. You may perform the On the Fence stunt for 1 SP.\n\nExpert\nWhen you attempt a detailed social maneuverer (see Chapter 5: Game Play), you require one fewer shift (to a minimum of 1) to succeed. If the situation only requires a simple social maneuverer, add +1 to your roll.\n\nMaster\nWherever you go, you fit in with ease. When you interact with people who would have an attitude of Neutral or worse toward you, they automatically shift it one step in your favour. This benefit disappears if subjects feel physically threatened by you or your allies, however.\n\nStar\nYou can sway people with your performance, personal charisma, and fame.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nCommunication 2 or higher and the Communication (Performing) focus.\n\nNovice\nWhen using the Communication (Performing) focus, you may perform the Sway the Crowd stunt for 1 SP.\n\nExpert\nA good performance opens doors, and makes people want to know you. You can perform the Oozing Confidence stunt for 2 SP.\n\nMaster\nWhen you need to, you can pull out all of the stops with a performance. When you attempt a social grand gesture (see Chapter 5: Game Play), your success threshold for each shift is one less than it would normally be.\n\nThief\nYou are adept at stealing things and avoiding getting caught.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nDexterity 2 or higher and the Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) and Dexterity (Stealth) focuses.\n\nNovice\nThe first thing a skilled thief perfects is the ability to work unnoticed. You add +1 to all tests made with the Dexterity (Stealth) or the Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) focuses. Choose which focus receives this benefit when you attain this degree.\n\nExpert\nWhen you make a Dexterity test to hide or steal an object, you can re-roll the test if you choose, but must keep the result of the second roll. You become an expert in avoiding suspicion. You may perform the It Wasn’t Me stunt for 2 SP.\n\nMaster\nAdd another +1 to tests using either Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or Dexterity (Stealth), selecting the focus when you attain this degree.\n\nTrader\nYou get things and people where they need to go, and you make a profit while doing so.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nIntelligence 2 or higher and the Intelligence (Business) focus.\n\nNovice\nYou’re good at reading people, and you’re excellent at understanding trends. Add +1 to Perception (Intuition) tests.\n\nExpert\nYou’re savvy when it comes to finances, loop holes, and opportunities. If you fail an Intelligence (Business) test, you can re-roll it, but must keep the result of the second roll.\n\nMaster\nOnce per session when you succeed on an Intelligence (Business) test to buy or sell goods or bid for available jobs with a client, you may increase or decrease your Drama Die by 1 without spending Fortune (or increasing the Churn for altering the dice).",

If they would take damage before your next turn, 1 damage point per SP spent transfers to you instead as you interpose yourself in front of the attack.\n\n1+\nSkirmish\nMove yourself or your attack’s target 2 meters in any direction for each 1 SP you spend. If this movement would expose the target to a hazard, such as pushing them off a ledge, roll an opposed test of your attacking ability versus the target’s Strength (Might) or Dexterity (Acrobatics), whichever is higher. If you lose the test, the target doesn’t move.\n\n1\nWhatever’s Handy\nImmediately arm yourself with anything in your environment you can reasonably wield as a makeshift weapon (see Makeshift Weapons in this Chapter 5 of The Expanse RPG).\n\n2+\nGroup Tactics\nChoose one ally to move 2 meters in a direction of their choosing for each 2 SP spent.\n\n2\nDouble-Team\nChoose one ally to make an immediate attack on your target, who must be within range and sight of the ally’s attack.\n\n2\nInjure\nIf your target has lost half or more of their Fortune, your attack imposes an injured condition so long as its damage exceeds the target’s Toughness. This condition does not reduce the attack’s damage.\n\n2\nKnock Prone\nKnock your enemy prone (see Prone under Conditions in Chapter 1 of The Expanse RPG).\n\n2\nLightning Attack\nMake a second attack on your turn, either against the same target or a different target.\n\n2\nOvercome Toughness\nAgainst this attack’s damage, the target’s Toughness is considered to be half its normal value, rounded down.\n\n2\nTaunt\nRoll an opposed test of Communication (Deception) vs. Willpower (Self-Discipline) against any target within 10 meters of you; if you win, they must attack or oppose you in some way on their next turn.\n\n2\nVicious Blow\nInflict an extra 1d6 damage on this attack.\n\n3\nExpose\nDestroy or move any one object in weapon range, such as a door or crate, that could provide cover. This can take out small sections of larger objects like pillars or walls. The GM may rule some objects are too heavy or tough to be removed by this stunt, such as the bulkheads of spaceships and stations.\n\n3\nShock and Awe\nWhen you succeed at a non-attack physical feat or take an opponent out, anyone who witnesses it rolls Willpower (Courage) or (Morale) vs. your Strength (Intimidation). If you win, they suffer a −1 to the next opposed roll they make against you, or a −1 to their Defence vs. your next attack against them, whichever comes first.\n\n4\nKnock Out\nIf your target has lost half or more of their Fortune, your attack imposes an unconscious condition so long as its damage exceeds the target’s Toughness.\n\n4\nSeize the Initiative\nMove to the top of the initiative order until someone else seizes the initiative. You may get to take another turn before some others act again.\n\n5\nLethal Blow\nInflict an extra 2d6 damage on this attack.\n\n5\nWound\nIf your target has lost half or more of their Fortune, your attack imposes a wounded condition so long as its damage exceeds the target’s Toughness. This condition does not reduce the attack’s damage.\n\nGun Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1-3\nOverwatch\nYour opponent suffers −1 to attack rolls per SP spent until the start of your next turn.\n\n1-4\nPrecision Marksmanship\nIf you make an attack with a firearm that benefits from an Aim bonus before the end of your next turn, increase the aim bonus by +1 per SP spent.\n\n1-3\nRicochet\nMake a trick shot that ignores (SP spent) of the armour rating of a target behind cover.\n\n1-3\nShort Burst (Automatic)\nIgnore one point of your opponent’s Toughness per SP spent.\n\n1-3\nStrafe (Automatic)\nImmediately move up to (SP spent) meters in any direction, and apply this attack to anyone within (SP spent) meters of your original target; you can’t selectively exclude anyone in the area. Halve the damage dealt to the additional targets (round up).\n\n1-5\nSuppressive Fire (Automatic)\nAt the end of each character’s turn until the start of your next turn (including allies and your current target), make a new attack against that character if they’re within (SP) meters of the spot where your target stands right now.\n\n1\nRapid Reload\nNext time you miss with a firearm, immediately reload without checking against Capacity.\n\n2+\nEfficient Gunner\nNext time you miss with a firearm, subtract 1 from the Drama Die’s result for each 2 SP spent, for purposes of checking against Capacity.\n\n2\nLong Burst (Automatic)\nMake a second attack against the same target or a different one within 5 meters of the first; take a −2 to this attack roll, but gain a +2 to the damage roll if you hit. Immediately check ammo against Capacity afterward.\n\n3\nPistol Whip (Pistol)\nIf the attack hits an opponent adjacent to you, or next time you miss with a firearm against an opponent adjacent to you and run out of ammo, make a second attack against the same target with Accuracy (Pistols) to club them with the gun, inflicting 1d6 + Strength damage.\n\n4\nCalled Shot\nYou target an exposed part of your opponent’s body. The attack’s damage becomes penetrating.\n\n4\nSniper’s Perch\nYou find high ground or another advantageous shooting position. In addition to the usual benefits, if you attack with a firearm on your next turn, double your weapon’s short and long ranges for that turn.\n\n5\nSpray and Pray (Automatic)\nApply this attack to every target within a 5-meter radius of your original target, including allies, using the same attack test result. All additional targets gain +1 to Defence against this attack.\n\nMelee Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1-3\nParry\nYour opponent suffers −1 to Defence per SP spent until your next turn, as you guide their limb or weapon off-centre, throwing off their balance.\n\n1+\nFootwork\nYou manoeuvre effortlessly. Gain +1 per SP spent to one combat-related test of your choice before the end of your next turn.\n\n1\nFeint\nReduce your target’s initiative by 1 (to a minimum of 1) for the rest of the encounter.\n\n2\nDisarm\nYou and your target make opposed melee attack rolls; if you win, knock your enemy’s weapon 1d6 + Strength meters away in a direction of your choice.\n\n3\nHamstring\nCumulatively reduce your target’s Speed by 3 for the rest of the encounter. If it’s reduced to 0, they become restrained for the rest of the encounter and cannot move.\n\n3\nBind Weapon\nYou and your opponent make opposed melee attack rolls; if you win, your opponent’s next melee attack against you automatically misses.\n\n4\nArmour Crush\nConvert up to 3 points of damage you would inflict on your foe with this attack into a penalty to their worn armour instead, based on the type of damage you dealt. This penalty lasts for 1d6 rounds or until they take a major action to readjust their armour, whichever comes first.\n\n5\nBreak Weapon\nYou and your opponent make opposed melee attack rolls; if you win, your destroy your opponent’s weapon, rendering it unusable.\n\nGrappling Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1-3\nHinder\nMelee attacks your opponent makes before the start of your next turn reduce their damage by 2 per SP spent.\n\n1\nGrapple\nYou and your target make opposed Fighting (Grappling) rolls; if you win, they can’t move from where they are on their next turn. You and the target both take a −2 Defence penalty until the beginning of your next turn.\n\n2\nTakedown\nYou and your target make opposed Fighting (Grappling) rolls; if you win, you and your target fall prone; your target takes an additional 1d6 damage and can’t stand up until you do, or until they succeed at an attack against you.\n\n3\nHuman Shield\nYou and your target make opposed Fighting (Grappling) rolls; if you win, any failed ranged attack against you hits your target instead, and ranged attacks against you take a −2 penalty, until the beginning of your next turn.\n\n3\nStrangle\nRoll Fighting (Grappling) vs. your target’s Constitution (Stamina); if you win, the target must spend their minor action catching their breath on their next turn.\n\n4\nHostage\nYou and your target make opposed Fighting (Grappling) rolls; if you win, you maneuverer them into a vulnerable position. If they do anything other than a free action on their next turn, or if anyone attacks you or your allies before the beginning of your next turn, you may make an immediate attack against your target with a +2 bonus to the Drama Die.\n\n4\nPin\nYou and your target make opposed Fighting (Grappling) rolls; if you win, they can’t do anything other than a free action on their next turn. You and the target both take a −4 Defence penalty until the beginning of your next turn.\n\n5\nRestrain\nIf you have appropriate equipment in hand, like handcuffs or rope, you and your target make opposed Fighting (Grappling) rolls; if you win, they become restrained (see Conditions in Chapter 1 of The Expanse RPG), and can’t do anything other than try to escape with a Strength (Might) or Dexterity (Sabotage) test as a major action, with TN = 10 + (your Fighting (Grappling) score).\n\nChase Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1+\nPunch It\nYou gain a +1 bonus on your next chase test for each 1 SP you spend.\n\n2\nEvasive Manoeuvre\nUntil your next turn, attacks against you and your vehicle (if any) suffer a −2 penalty.\n\n2\nFollow the Leader\nMake a test with a TN you choose and an ability focus you work out with the GM for pulling off a tricky manoeuvre, such as Dexterity (Acrobatics) to slip through a small opening on the run, or Dexterity (Piloting) to do the same while flying. If you fail, you crash. Anyone following you using the same method of transport must make the same test or crash.\n\n3\nAttack on the Move\nYou can make a bonus melee or ranged attack, use the bonus Activate action to use an in-built weapon system, or make a bonus Ram attack against an enemy within range and line of sight, at a −2 penalty to the roll. You must have a loaded missile weapon to make a ranged attack.\n\n3\nKeep It Steady\nUntil the beginning of your next turn, passengers gain a +1 bonus when making attacks or making other ability tests that would benefit from stable platform (leaping from vehicle to vehicle, for example).\n\n4\nInterference\nA character of your choice suffers a −2 penalty on their next chase test.\n\n5\nShort Cut\nAdd an additional +2 to your chase total.\n\nExploration Stunts\nGeneral Exploration Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1-3\nWhen a Plan Comes Together\nYou reveal this test was part of your plan all along, granting a bonus equal to the SP spent on one ally’s next test during the same encounter to accomplish the same goal. If desired, you can split the bonus among multiple allies, giving each a minimum +1. You must make this decision before any ally rolls.\n\n1+\nA Stitch in Time\nYou put in the effort to do it right the first time, setting yourself up for greater success later. Gain +1 per SP spent on your next test related to this one during this encounter, as long as this roll was part of an advanced test.\n\n1+\nPay Dirt\nIn the course of your endeavour, you win a bet, happen across a conveniently abandoned stash, or discover something valuable you can pawn to make a buck, among other possibilities. Temporarily gain +1 Income per SP spent; this increase lasts until you next fail an Income test. Instances of this stunt don’t stack; only the highest bonus applies.\n\n2\nJury Rig\nYou find or improvise a piece of equipment you need to be more effective. Negate any situational penalties you would suffer for lacking proper equipment on tests appropriate to the improvisation, for the rest of the encounter.\n\n2\nSpeed Demon\nYou complete your test in half the time it would otherwise take.\n\n3\nThe Upper Hand\nIf your success leads to combat within the encounter, you receive a +3 on your initiative roll.\n\n4\nWith a Flourish\nYou impress everyone who watches you with your ability. Gain a +1 to opposed tests against them for the rest of the encounter\n\n5\nFrugal\nYou use only what you must to get the job done, saving resources for a rainy day. This Income test doesn’t deplete your Income even if it normally would.\n\nInfiltration Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1+\nJust a Shadow\nGain +1 per SP spent to your next test during this encounter as long as you remain unnoticed.\n\n1\nGood Instincts\nMake a Perception test using an appropriate focus (GM’s choice) with the same TN as the test you just made to learn the most likely immediate consequence of the action you just performed.\n\n1+\nCalming the Waters\nReduce the current Churn Pool by the SP spent. See The Churn in Chapter 12 of The Expanse RPG for details.\n\n1\nBravery\nYour success bolsters your courage, granting you 1d6 extra Toughness against the next damaging hazard you face in this encounter.\n\n2\nOver Here!\nYour flashy action makes you the centre of attention. Each of your allies gains +1 to their next test to hide or pass scrutiny in this encounter, such as Dexterity (Stealth) or Communication (Disguise). Any action an opponent takes until then automatically targets you.\n\n2\nTake One for the Team\nWhen you successfully avoid damage from hazard but an ally doesn’t, you may take the damage for that ally while they remain unaffected.\n\n3\nCover Your Tracks\nWhether you’re hacking into a network, evading the cops, or infiltrating a military base, you impose a −2 on all future rolls to follow your trail related to this test.\n\n3\nHigh Tech Hustle\nWith an injection of technobabble or a quick mod to a device, you sidestep one minor complication impeding your current goal, or give yourself the ability to perform one task you otherwise couldn’t in the current situation, at the GM’s discretion.\n\n4\nIt Wasn’t Me\nYou leave evidence another character is responsible for the results of your test, such as breaking and entering, cheating at cards, or uploading a computer virus. All failed tests to investigate the truth reveal that person as the culprit, and such tests suffer a −2 penalty.\n\n5\nFancy Meeting You Here\nChoose a focus or talent your character doesn’t possess. An NPC of the GM’s choice with that focus or talent appears in the scene within a few minutes, or a few rounds if your action leads directly to action time. This doesn’t dictate anything about their situation, attitude, or identity; these are all up to the GM.\n\nInvestigation Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1-3\nA-ha!\nThe GM reveals an additional useful fact about the object of your test per SP spent (Simple); gain +1 per SP spent to your next test following up on the lead you just unlocked (Detailed).\n\n1\nFlashback\nThis test reminds you of something important you forgot. The GM reveals the identity or existence of another source of information you didn’t know about (Simple); treat one of your tangential focuses as a primary one on the next test you make to unlock a lead related to this test (Detailed).\n\n2\nIntuition\nThe GM reveals a fact about the object of your test you could not have noticed or deduced simply by interacting with it (Simple); when you uncover a clue, you gain two new leads instead of one, making the path branch (Detailed).\n\n3\nLucky Break (Detailed)\nThis test’s result leads fortuitously to putting two and two together later. Treat one irrelevant focus as a tangential one on the next test you make to unlock a lead related to this test.\n\n4\nDown the Rabbit Hole (Detailed)\nIf this test led to a reveal, the GM also provides a brand new lead about a new subject that will lead to greater rewards.\n\n5\nBreakthrough\nYou gain not only information but some form of incontrovertible proof (Simple); reduce the total number of leads on the path by one, jumping to a further point in the investigation immediately (Detailed).\n\nSocial Stunts\nAttitude Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1-3\nMaking an Offer\nYour test implies a promise or olive branch, temporarily shifting the target’s Attitude toward you up by one per SP spent (even if this test already shifted it); it shifts back by the same amount as soon as you fail a social test against them. Inapplicable when performing a grand gesture.\n\n1\nRead the Room\nThe GM reveals the current Attitude, or an intention or mood indicator, for one character present of your choice, in reaction to your test. You can choose this stunt multiple times per roll. Characters with either the Communication (Deception) or Willpower (Self-Discipline) focus may roll vs. your Perception (Empathy) to avoid this.\n\n2\nOn the Fence\nChoose a character you didn’t target who’s Standoffish, Neutral, or Open toward you. They’re convinced to take your side in the conflict, as long as they don’t already oppose you (Simple); shift their Attitude toward you up by one for the rest of the encounter (Detailed).\n\n3\nBad Form\nImmediately regain the SP you spent on this stunt, plus 1 more. Then choose any character present; they now consider you a rival, threat, or enemy, shifting their Attitude to Hostile if it was Standoffish or Neutral, or shifting it to its negative variation if it was more positive. Inapplicable if all NPCs present are already Hostile toward you.\n\n3\nCast Out\nYour action shames or embarrasses another character present, imposing a −2 penalty on their next social roll against anyone but you in this encounter (Simple) or worsening the Attitude of one other character present toward them by one shift (Detailed).\n\n4\nRisky Business\nYour action reveals a secret or contains a significant lie, shifting your target’s Attitude toward another character in the scene from Neutral or worse to Very Hostile; it also worsens your target’s Attitude toward you by one shift, as they’re inclined to shoot the messenger. If you lied and the target later finds out, their Attitude toward you shifts to Very Hostile as well.\n\n5\nMeddle\nYour action brings others together or drives a wedge between them. Choose two other characters present and shift their Attitudes toward each other up or down by one (both in the same direction)\n\nGeneral Social Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1-3\nImpress\nGain a +1 per SP spent to your next social test against the same target as this test, during this encounter.\n\n1\nCards on the Table\nIf you were completely honest when making this test, your target must be completely honest in the next social test they make against you during this encounter. This doesn’t stop either character from omitting information or offering misleading truths.\n\n1\nMaking an Entrance\nIf this is your first action of the encounter, gain +1 to your next opposed roll against one character who witnessed it. You can choose this stunt multiple times per roll.\n\n2\nAnd Another Thing\nMake a second, related test as part of your action, before anyone else has a chance to respond or make any tests of their own.\n\n2\nHidden Message\nYour words convey a different message to one person than to everyone else who hears them; the character you choose is the only one who can decipher your true meaning.\n\n2\nSway the Crowd\nYour words affect one additional person of your choice. You may choose this stunt multiple times per roll, but if someone opposed your test you can’t expand the effect to anyone with a higher ability + focus total than the original target.\n\n3\nGood Cop/Bad Cop\nChoose an ally to immediately make a test in seeming opposition to the one you just made, with the same target. If they succeed, rather than garnering the usual results, they prompt the target to give up a secret you didn’t already know.\n\n3\nLet’s Make a Deal\nYour action turns out to benefit a character you didn’t target, who now owes you a favor, however grudgingly.\n\n3\nObjection!\nYou step in on someone else’s behalf. Another character in the scene may use your ability + focus score instead of their own next time they oppose a test during this encounter.\n\n4\nClass Clown\nYour words lighten the mood, imposing a –2 penalty to all enemies’ initiative rolls if a fight breaks out during this encounter.\n\n4\nFlirt\nRoll Communication (Seduction) vs. your target’s Willpower (Self-Discipline) as a simple social roll against a character whose Attitude toward you is Open or better, with a positive bent; if you win, they become enamoured with your character, opening the door to future romance or intimacy. How this proceeds is up to you and the GM to work out together.\n\n4\nFrom the Heart\nYou believe wholeheartedly in what you say. Choose one Willpower focus. If you don’t have it already, gain it for the rest of the encounter. If you do, it adds +3 instead of +2 to rolls you make with it.\n\n4\nSleep with One Eye Open\nApplies to a test targeting someone you have a negative Relationship with, or who has harmed someone you have a Relationship with. The next attack you make against that target in this session is automatically a surprise attack, as long as they weren’t already in combat.\n\n5\nEnrage\nChoose one character present whose Attitude toward you is Neutral or worse, or a negative variant of a more positive Attitude. They must immediately either attack you or storm out of the scene. If they attack, it needn’t be deadly, though it can be.\n\n5\nPatter\nYour rapid-fire words confuse your target, who must succeed at a Perception (Empathy) roll vs. your Communication (Deception), or automatically fail their next non-attack test against you.\n\n7\nMy Word is My Bond\nApplies to a test relevant to completing a task you’ve promised someone you have a Relationship with you’ll perform. Gain +2 to tests directly related to completing this task until the end of the session. This stunt requires bonus SP available from a Relationship in order to meet the necessary cost.\n\nMembership &amp; Reputation Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1\nBon Mot\nYou tag the perfect witty remark onto the end of your action. If you can’t think of one, let the group brainstorm and pick one among their ideas. Gain a temporary honorific you can use for passive Reputation only, for the rest of the session.\n\n1\nStick Your Neck Out\nYour test puts your own Reputation in jeopardy to help someone else. An ally of your choice gains a +2 bonus to their next social test in this encounter; if they fail, you lose all Reputation bonuses from one honorific for the rest of the session.\n\n2\nIn Good Standing\nWhen targeting a member of an organization in which you have Membership, treat your rank as one higher for purposes of gaining access to resources for the rest of this encounter.\n\n3\nBenefit of the Doubt\nYour action impresses or charms any one character present. Roll Communications (Persuasion) vs. Willpower (Self-Discipline) to affect someone with an Attitude of Hostile or worse; no roll is necessary for others. Increase all relevant Membership and Reputation bonuses by +1 while interacting with that character for the rest of the session; may improve their Attitude toward you, at the GM’s discretion.\n\n3\nGo Viral\nWhether via you or others sharing a video or audio recording, news gets out quickly about what you’ve just done. For the rest of the session, the honorific most related to this test applies even in situations where it seems unrelated.\n\n4\nOozing Confidence\nYour action impresses or fools all the right people. Gain one temporary Reputation honorific or rank of Membership for the rest of the session, or until you next fail a test relevant to this influence, whichever comes first.\n\n5\nName-dropping\nYour action displays your affiliation with someone whose Membership rank is higher than yours in an organization to which you belong, or who has a relevant honorific you don’t. You may use their Reputation or Membership benefits with that honorific or organization as your own for the rest of the session; if they find out and disapprove, worsen their Attitude toward you by one shift.\n\nProfession Stunts\nBounty Hunter Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1-4\nThe Upper Hand\nDuring the making contact encounter, you gain a bonus to your initiative test against your target equal to the SP spent (up to +4). This is a version of The Upper Hand exploration stunt unique to bounty hunting.\n\n2–6\nWhat Makes Them Tick\nYou get a real sense for your target and what motivates them; for your next social encounter with the target, you gain a bonus to all interaction tests equal to half the SP spent (up to +3 for 6 SP).\n\n5\nSaw That Coming\nWhen you make contact with your target, you can choose one thing that they do in response to you, when it happens, and retroactively declare you had previously prepared for it. So, for example, if the target ducks out the back exit, you can use this stunt to declare you have an ally waiting there for them. The GM approves your choice, and it can only involve resources reasonably at your disposal during the hunt.\n\nEntertainer Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1-3\n“I'm with the band!”\nBy telling people you’re a performer and implying—correctly or otherwise—that you are somehow part of the evening’s entertainment, you can get into just about any club, bar, concert hall, theatre, or other entertainment venue immediately and at no cost, even if they’re sold out. This also lets you get backstage, though it doesn’t necessarily grant access to guarded celebrities or restricted areas you have no business visiting (such as server rooms). The cost of this Stunt depends on how plausible your presence is; a grungy Belter musician famous for their hardcore Banger sound would spend 1 to get into a Belter concert venue, but that same musician claiming they’re part of the John Carter Follies musical revival at the Grand Red Opry on Mars would require at least 2 points, and saying they’re with the acclaimed Lunar Ballet production of Senza Peso is definitely going to cost 3 points. Note that the GM has the final say over whether this Stunt is plausible enough to apply to a situation.\n\n1-3\nRight in the Feels\nYou know how to read your audience and tune your performance for maximum impact. For each point spent on this Stunt, treat the number on the Drama Die as one higher for the purposes of determining the degree of success on a performance roll. Note that this does not change the actual die roll result, only the degree of success when relevant.\n\nJournalist Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1-3\nHardball\nYou are adept at asking tough questions and getting honest answers, even if it ruffles some feathers. You may spend SP to impose a -1 penalty on Deception tests for anyone who tries to lie to you during questioning. You may also force an opponent to re-roll a Deception test, but you must abide by this new result, and their Attitude shifts a degree less favourable toward you afterward.\n\n2+\nFourth Estate\nYou temporarily gain a rank of Membership in an organization you’ve been covering or researching, with the rank equal to the SP spent -1. This lasts for the rest of the session. You are not actually a member, but you’ve gained enough trust of those in the organization that as long as you don’t violate their rules, they will take you under their wing for a time.\n\n3\nPress Pass\nBy announcing yourself as a member of the press and presenting appropriate credentials, you can gain access to a restricted area or situation where a member of the press might plausibly be admitted (even if it’s unlikely). You probably can’t convince the MCRN to let you waltz onto a battleship currently preparing for battle, for example, but you might be able to get on base to speak to a commander during an alert.\n\nVehicle Combat\nVehicle Combat Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1-3\nSystem Damage\nYour attack damages the vehicle’s Handling, Sensors, or Weapons. Impose a –1 penalty per SP spent to the damaged ability (up to 3). This penalty remains until the vehicle is repaired. Damage control with a TN 13 Intelligence (Engineering) test can negate (but not remove) the penalty for rounds equal to the Drama Die result. If the ability is reduced below –2, the vehicle automatically fails tests calling for it. If Handling is reduced below –2 the vehicle is out of control and helpless.\n\n1+\nPenetrate Hull\nYour attack overcomes the vehicle’s resistance to damage. If a vehicle has a Hull rating, you must spend SP equal to it on this stunt before spending SP on other stunts.\n\n2\nOff-Course\nThe vehicle is thrown off-course and the operator must make a TN 15 test to maintain control. A new test can be made each round to regain control if it is lost.\n\n2\nScuttle\nYour attack destroys the target vehicle. This stunt is only available against a helpless vehicle.\n\n2+\nShrapnel\nThe attack causes a damaging explosion in the vehicle’s interior. The operator and all passengers in the same compartment suffer 1d6 damage for 2 SP or 2d6 damage for 4 SP.\n\n3+\nHull Breach\nYou inflict significant damage to the vehicle, reducing its Hull rating by 1 per 3 SP spent. The loss of Hull rating lasts until repaired.\n\n3\nSlowdown\nYou damage the vehicle’s propulsion, dropping its Speed class by one category. If it drops to Slow or less, the operator must make a TN 15 test to maintain control. The slowdown remains until repaired. Damage control with a TN 13 Intelligence (Engineering) test can negate (but not remove) the penalty for rounds equal to the Drama Die result.\n\n4\nDisable Drive\nYour attack disables the vehicle’s propulsion. The operator must make a TN 15 test to maintain control and, even if they succeed, must deal with a vehicle that can no longer move or maneuver under its own power. The vehicle is helpless. Damage control with a TN 13 Intelligence (Engineering) test can restore the vehicle’s Speed at one degree lower than usual for rounds equal to the Drama Die result.\n\n4+\nSkewer\nYour attack is in just the right place to do serious damage inside the vehicle: One character suffers 4d6 damage for 4 SP, or 6d6 damage for 6 SP, or the full damage of your weapon +2d6, whichever is less.\n\n5\nRupture\nYour attack ruptures a fuel line or power conduit, causing an internal explosion. This deals 3d6 penetrating damage to everyone in a particular compartment of the vehicle and also causes the effects of either a System Damage (3 SP) or Slowdown stunt.\n\n6\nDisable Engine\nYour attack disables the vehicle’s engine or main power, such as a ship’s reactor, causing the effect of a Disable Drive stunt and leaving the vehicle completely without power other than emergency back-ups and essentially helpless. Damage control with a TN 13 Intelligence (Engineering) test can restore power for rounds equal to the Drama Die result. Otherwise the power remains offline until repaired.\n\nSpace Combat: Command Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1+\nGuidance\nYou grant a +1 bonus to a chosen ship combat test this round for each 1 SP you spend. Choose one of the following: manoeuvre test, electronic warfare test, evasion test, point defence test, or damage control test.\n\n1+\nBlinding Manoeuvre\nYou manoeuvre your ship in such a way as to blind or limit an opponent’s Sensors. Each SP you spend reduces an opposing ship’s Sensors score by 1 (to a minimum score of –2) until the start of the next round.\n\n2\nMulti-Targeting\nYour ship’s point defence cannons (if any) can both attack and defend this round without any penalty (see Point Defence under Defensive Actions, following).\n\n2+\nOn-Target\nEvery 2 SP you spend increases the TN of tests to evade your ship’s weapon attacks that round by +1.\n\n2+\nTactics\nEvery 2 SP you spend increase the TN of an opposing ship commander’s next command test by +1.\n\n3+\nEvasive Action\nEvery 3 SP you spend grants a +1d6 Hull bonus to your ship that round for resisting damage from successful weapon attacks.\n\n3\nPerceived Weakness\nYou increase the damage of one successful weapon attack by 1d6. This stunt is a risk, as it has to come in Step 5 of the round, and requires a successful hit.\n\n3+\nEvasive Action\nGrants a +1d6 Hull bonus to your ship that round for resisting damage from successful weapon attacks.\n\n3+\nCalculation\nYou can bank the SP you just spent for this stunt +1 and use them on a later stunt. You can also combine these SP with future SP earned.\n\n4\nPrecise Hit\nOne of your successful weapon attacks results in an additional Loss, even if the target’s Hull completely eliminated the damage.\n\n4\nSkimming\nIf a space battle takes place near a planet with an atmosphere, you can dive into the planet’s atmosphere to avoid being targeted and perhaps even lose your pursuer completely.Your pilot must make an opposed TN 17 Dexterity (Piloting) test to succeed:Success -&gt; the pursuing ship loses track of your ship in the atmosphere, at least temporarily.On following rounds, the pursuing ship can make opposed TN 11 Intelligence (Technology) + Sensors tests to reacquire a target on your ship.\n\n4\nToo Close\nTo perform this stunt, you must be engaged against multiple enemy ships and at close range to one that is of at least one size class larger. A space station can also count as a larger ship.The pilot manoeuvres into a position that makes it difficult for enemies to target your ship without risking damage to the other ship.During the Manoeuvre phase, the pilot must make a successful opposed TN 15 Dexterity (Piloting) test against the larger ship at -2. The difficulty is reduced by 1 for every additional size class greater the enemy ship is than the crew’s ship:- Success à the pilot gains a+2 to their evasion test against any ships other than the ship they are using for cover- Any attacks that miss the crew’s ship hit the larger ship if the pilot rolls a 5 or 6 on the Drama Die.- If both ships fail the piloting test à the ships collide, causing 2d6 damage to the larger ship and 4d6 damage to the smaller ship.\n\n4+\nSet-Up\nYou manoeuvre an opposing ship into a hazard, such as a normally shorter range weapon, a field of debris, or even a floating rock. This stunt is considered a weapon attack inflicting damage dice equal to half the SP spent (round down). The Set-Up can be evaded; the TN is 10 + your Intelligence + Leadership focus (if any) + half the SP spent. So if a character with Intelligence 2 and Leadership spends 5 SP on this stunt, the TN to evade the Set-Up is (10 + 2 + 2 + 2.5, rounded down to 2) or 16, and a failure on the evasion test results in 2d6 damage to the target ship.\n\n5\nBurn Them\nAn Epstein drive emits a powerful drive plume that can, in a pinch, be used as a weapon. To do this successfully, the ship must be at close range and perform a sudden flip and burn that points the drive plume directly at the enemy ship.The ships must be at extremely close range, so this manoeuvre can’t be used in normal engagements - only if circumstances have dictated that the ships are very close (under 1 km). Unfortunately, this manoeuvre leaves the crew’s ship vulnerable and open to attack.To successfully perform this manoeuvre, the pilot must also make a successful opposed TN 19 Dexterity (Piloting) test against the other ship at -2. If successful, the other ship is engulfed in your drive plume, causing 6d6 damage. The downside is that only rear-facing weapons can fire while the ship performs this manoeuvre, and enemy ships have a +2 to their evasion tests. Also, due to being in an exposed position, all evasion tests are at -2. If the pilot fails this test, they fail to engulf the enemy ship with the drive plume but still suffer all of the associated penalties.\n\n5\nWeapon Online\nOne of the crew can temporarily bring a damaged weapon, or a weapon that has run out of ammo, back online.A character can attempt a TN 14 Intelligence (Engineering) or Dexterity (Gunnery) test to bring a weapon back online.The weapon can make 1d3 shots before giving up the ghost for good, requiring a proper repair. The weapon cannot be brought back online again without the ship receiving full maintenance at a spaceport.\n\n6\nQuick Start\nThe crew can attempt to make a quick repair and restart the ship’s reactor.This requires two characters to work together; one must make a TN 14 Intelligence (Technology) test and another must make a TN 14 Intelligence (Engineering) test, and they must reach a threshold of 15.\n\n7\nMisdirect\nWhen attempting to outrun a torpedo, you can fly close to another ship to try to get the torpedo to hit that ship instead of your own. You perform a flip and burn when near another ship.The pilot must make a successful opposed Dexterity (Piloting) test against the other ship and another member of the crew must make a TN 17 Technology (Intelligence) test. If both are successful, the torpedo impacts the other ship instead.\n\nSpace Combat: Piloting Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1+\nBlinding Manoeuvre\nReduces an opposing ship’s Sensors score by 1 (to a minimum score of –2) until the start of the next round.\n\n2+\nSteady as She Goes\nPilot can lessen the potential high-g manoeuvres damage to passengers. For every 2 SP spent the TN for the Constitution (Stamina) test is reduced by 1.\n\n3+\nEvasive Action\nGrants a +1d6 Hull bonus to your ship that round for resisting damage from successful weapon attacks.\n\n4\nBlockade\nThe pilot manoeuvres the ship to make it difficult for an enemy ship to fire on or pursue its chosen target (unless that target is the pilot’s ship).The enemy ship suffers a -2 penalty to any manoeuvre test to pursue or attack its original target. Or the targeted ship gets a +2 to its evasion test.\n\n4+\nSet-up\nYou manoeuvre an opposing ship into a hazard, such as a normally shorter-range weapon, a field of debris, or even a floating rock.This stunt is considered a weapon attack inflicting damage dice equal to half the SP spent (round down).Can be evaded with the TN = 10 + your Intelligence + Leadership focus (if any) + half the SP spent\n\nSpace Combat: Electronic Warfare Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1+\nEye Patch\nReduce the TN of a damage control test to repair a loss to Sensors by 1 for each SP spent.\n\n1+\nEat Static\nYou adjust your ship’s active emissions in a way that makes it harder to target, adding +SP to your ship’s next electronic warfare test.\n\n2+\nTurnabout is Fair Play\nIf a torpedo is being manually controlled, the sensors operator can attempt to wrest control of the torpedo from the other ship. If there is more than one torpedo, 2 SP can be spent to attempt to control each.Opposed Intelligence (Technology) + Sensors test against the enemy ship.\n\n3\nExploitable Terrain\nIf you are near appropriate exploitable terrain (asteroid field, dust cloud), you spot a path near or through it that the pilot (whether you or another character) can use as protective cover.

They can attempt to hack the enemy’s ship to temporarily disable one or more systems. To do this, a PC must make an opposed Intelligence (Technology) + Sensors test against the enemy ship. If successful, they can shut down one system on that ship (weapons, sensors, engines, etc.). They remain offline until someone on the enemy ship makes a successful TN 15 Intelligence (Technology) test.\n\nSpace Combat: Weapons Officer Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n2\nMulti-targeting\nPBCs can both attack and defend this round without any penalty.\n\n2+\nOn-target\nIncreases the TN of tests of your opponent to evade your ship’s weapon attacks that round by +1.\n\n4\nPrecise hit\nOne successful weapon attack results in an additional Loss, even if the target’s Hull completely eliminated the damage\n\nSpace Combat: Engineer Stunts\n\nCost\nStunt\nDescription\n\n1+\nNot My Ship!\nThe Engineer can spend Fortune to reduce damage taken by the ship just as it were part of the hull.

		"content": "Affluent\nYou have access to greater resources than most.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nNone\n\nNovice\nWhen you select this talent, increase your Income by +2.\n\nExpert\nWhen you gain this degree, increase your Income by +1. You may add 2 to your Income score when comparing your score with an item’s cost to purchase it automatically, without a test, or to determine whether the purchase will deplete your Income. You enjoy this benefit only once per game session, and you must choose whether it applies to an automatic purchase or to avoid depleting your Income.\n\nMaster\nWhen you gain this degree, increase your Income by +1. You can re-roll a failed Income test, but must keep the result of the second roll\n\nAgility\nYou move with grace, speed, and ease.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nDexterity 2 and the Dexterity (Acrobatics) focus\n\nNovice\nEvery move you make is part of one fluid motion. Using the Move action to stand up, climb, dismount, etc. does not reduce your Speed.\n\nExpert\nWhen you move, terrain-based hazards do not reduce your Speed. When you fall, if you succeed at a Dexterity (Acrobatics) test with a TN determined by the GM based on height and nearby surfaces, you suffer only half damage.\n\nMaster\nImpressive acrobatics are just the way you naturally move. You can re-roll any die result of 1 on each die for Dexterity (Acrobatics), Stamina (Running), and Strength (Climbing, Jumping) tests, but must keep the results of the second roll.\n\nArtistry\nYou can create fine works of art. For the performing arts, see the Performance talent.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nCommunication 1 or higher and the Dexterity (Crafting) focus or Communication (Expression) focus\n\nNovice\nYou can use the Dexterity (Crafting) or Communication (Expression) focuses to create works of art. Choose a field of visual (painting, sculpture, illustration, animation, photography, etc.) or literary (poetry, fiction, scriptwriting, journalism, etc.) arts. The GM determines the time and TN of the test, depending on your intentions, and the Drama Die determines your work’s quality if you succeed. You can sell your work if you know a buyer, giving you a temporary bonus to Income tests equal to half the result of the Drama Die (minimum 1); this bonus disappears upon your first successful Income test to purchase something, or at the end of the current story if you have not used it. As an option you can waive the bonus to Income and gain a temporary reputation instead. This reputation fades over time if you don’t produce other works of similar quality. Any reputation derived from your art disappears after a number of months equal to the result of the Drama Die.\n\nExpert\nYou grow as an artist, deepening your mastery of your craft or diversifying your talents. You learn the tools and tricks of a new artistic field or gain a +1 bonus to ability tests to create works of art in a field you are trained in. This bonus also applies to the Drama Die result to determine the quality of your work.\n\nMaster\nYou become an undisputed master of your craft. You learn the tools and tricks of a number of artistic f ields equal to your Communication, or select one of the f ields you are trained in and add your Willpower to the Drama Die to determine the quality of your work. Upon successfully creating a work of art, you can re-roll the Drama Die to determine its quality, but must keep the result of the second roll.\n\nAttractive\nYou have that special something that catches and holds people’s attention and interest.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nNone\n\nNovice\nYour presence is as stunning upon the second impression as it is on the first. You can use the Making an Entrance social stunt a second time at any point of an encounter. Also, if an NPC could be attracted to you, their initial attitude is one step more favourable towards you.\n\nExpert\nYou know how to best exploit your appearance. You can perform the Flirt social stunt for 3 SP instead of its normal cost, and the target of your efforts can have a Neutral attitude instead of Open.\n\nMaster\nEvery move you make captures the attention and interest of others. When interacting with char acters who would be attracted to you, you can re-roll a failed Communication (Deception, Performing, Persuasion, or Seduction) test, but must keep the result of the second roll.\n\nBurglary\nYou know how to bypass security to enter a place and take anything that strikes your fancy.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nDexterity 2 or higher\n\nNovice\nYou know your way around security systems. When you succeed at an Intelligence (Security) test to study a lock, alarm, guards, or any part of a security system or protocol, the GM provides you with one more piece of information.\n\nExpert\nSecurity measures cannot stop you. If you fail an Intelligence (Technology) test involving a security measure, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll.\n\nMaster\nNo valuable escapes your notice. If you fail a Perception (Searching) test, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll.\n\nCarousing\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nCommunication and Constitution 1 or higher\n\nNovice\nYou can drink other people under the table. When making Constitution (Tolerance) tests as part of an advanced test, you gain a +1 bonus to the result of each Drama Die.\n\nExpert\nChoose one of the following focuses: Communication (Seduction) or Perception (Empathy). If you fail a test with your chosen focus, you can re-roll it but must keep the result of the second roll.\n\nMaster\nWhen you’re having a good time, you’re invincible! Or so you think. Choose the Benefit of the Doubt or Flirt stunt. You can perform that stunt for 1 SP less than its normal cost.\n\nCommand\nYou are a skilled and capable leader.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nCommunication 2 or higher\n\nNovice\nYour presence inspires allies. If you take a major action to offer guidance, your allies gain a +1 bonus to Willpower (Self-Discipline) and Willpower (Morale) tests for the rest of the encounter. You can do this once per encounter.\n\nExpert\nYour allies follow your lead. Any NPCs you lead gain a +1 bonus when rolling for initiative.\n\nMaster\nWhen you stand firm, your allies stand with you. When you lead NPCs in an encounter, they do not have to make a Willpower (Morale) test until more than two-thirds of your side’s combatants are out of the fight (dead or incapacitated). If you leave the fight or are taken out, this benefit is lost.\n\nContacts\nYou have a large web of social connections, and know people even in the unlikeliest places.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nCommunication 1 or higher\n\nNovice\nYou can attempt to make a contact out of an NPC with a Neutral or better attitude toward you with a successful Communication (Persuasion) test. The GM sets the target number based on the likelihood of you knowing the character or having mutual friends. The more distant the character’s origin or social class from yours, the more difficult the test. If you succeed, the new contact’s attitude shifts one step in your favour and they readily provide information without a test, as long as it wouldn’t harm them. They will not perform other favours without further persuasion.\n\nExpert\nOnce you’ve established a contact, you can try to get a favour from them with a single successful Communication (Persuasion) test, regardless of their attitude toward you and without engaging in a complex social interaction. The target number is based on the nature of the favour and whether it puts the contact in any danger.\n\nMaster\nYour social skills can turn a contact into an trusted ally. If you do a significant favour for an established contact, they become Very Friendly towards you, and any potential risk in the favours you ask of them does not affect the target number of the Communication (Persuasion) test from the Expert degree. If they’re already Very Friendly, they become zealously loyal; you do not need to make an ability test to ask favours of them, regardless of the danger involved, and the GM can use your ally to provide prompts if you become stuck in the course of a story in the form of unsolicited advice or favours. Allies’ attitudes can degrade if they’re not treated well, but do not do so simply with the passage of time. You can drift apart for a decade and they’ll still be as loyal as when you last met.\n\nDoctor\nYou have the skills to heal wounds and treat illness and other conditions.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nIntelligence (Medicine) focus\n\nNovice\nYou’re skilled in treating patients. You can re-roll any dice with a result of 1 or 2 when making an Intelligence (Medicine) test.\n\nExpert\nWith access to medical supplies and tools, you can treat some conditions. With an hour and a basic TN 11 Intelligence (Medicine) test you can remove a wounded condition, leaving the patient only injured (see Conditions in Chapter 1). You can also remove other medical-related conditions with proper time and treatment, at the GM’s discretion, using the Interlude guide lines in Chapter 5.\n\nMaster\nYou can perform complex medical proce dures to restore a patient to a normal, healthy condition, and you can re-roll any failed Intelligence (Medicine) test, but must keep the result of the second roll. When using Intelligence (Medicine) as a primary investigation focus, you generate +1 SP on any roll that generates stunt points.\n\nEngineering\nYou excel at putting things back together.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nIntelligence (Engineering) and Intelligence (Technology) focuses\n\nNovice\nIf you fail an Intelligence (Engineering) test, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll.\n\nExpert\nYou fix it once, your know your way. For the damage control advanced test, the success threshold is only +2 for every loss on the system, rather than +5.\n\nMaster\nWhen you make an advanced test using Intelligence (Engineering) or Intelligence (Technology), add +3 to the result of the Drama Die for the purpose of reaching the test’s threshold.\n\nExpertise\nYou are a specialist in your field.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nFocus in area of expertise\n\nNovice\nSelect an ability focus you have and choose a narrower task or field within it. You gain a +1 bonus for ability tests covered by the narrower task.\n\nExpert\nIf you fail an ability test covered by your chosen expertise, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll.\n\nMaster\nSelect one type of stunt (action, exploration, social, or command) relevant to your chosen expertise. When generating stunt points with ability tests involving your chosen expertise, you gain +1 SP for the chosen type of stunt.\n\nFringer\nYou know how to navigate and survive on the fringes of civilization.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nCommunication 1 or higher\n\nNovice\nYou cover your own tracks well. Other characters suffer a –2 penalty to any tests to find information about you or your activities. This stacks with the Cover Your Tracks stunt\n\nExpert\nYou know how to find and navigate the local black market. Once per session, you can gain a +2 bonus on an Income test by using black market channels, but your Income is depleted by 1 regardless of the test result and the cost of the item.\n\nMaster\nYou are experienced at living life hidden from the system. The penalty for tests to find information about you increases to –3, and when you buy on the black market, your Income score is depleted following the normal rules given in Chapter 2.\n\nHacking\nComputer security systems and safeguards are more suggestions to you than anything else.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nIntelligence (Security) and Intelligence (Technology) focuses\n\nNovice\nWhen you succeed at an Intelligence (Cryptography) or Intelligence (Security) test, the GM can provide you with an extra item of information about the subject. Also, you can use the Intelligence (Technology) focus instead of Communication (Investigation) and Intelligence (Research) if the information you seek can be found in an accessible computer system.\n\nExpert\nIf you fail an Intelligence (Technology) test, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll.\n\nMaster\nWhen you make an advanced test using Intelligence (Cryptography) or Intelligence (Technology), add +2 to the result of the Drama Die for the purpose of reaching the test’s threshold. You can perform the Cover Your Tracks stunt on tests involving the Cryptography and Technology focuses for 2 SP.\n\nImprovisation\nWhatever the situation is, you’re sure you can handle it.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nIntelligence 1 or Willpower 1 or higher\n\nNovice\nYou adapt to the situation. You can make an ability test that requires a specific focus, even if you don’t have that focus. You don’t gain the focus bonus to your roll and don’t generate SP on such rolls, but in investigations you are always considered to have a tangential focus (see Investigation Focuses in Chapter 5).\n\nExpert\nAnything is a potential weapon or a tool in your hands. When you perform the Whatever’s Handy combat stunt, the penalty of your makeshift weapon is reduced by 1 and it lasts 2d6 rounds before breaking. If improvising a tool instead of a weapon, you can perform tests that require the tool, but you don’t generate SP while doing so.\n\nMaster\nYou can turn failure into some measure of success. If you roll doubles on a failed test, you generate SP equal to the result of the Drama Die –2 (minimum 1). The test still fails, but you can try to salvage the situation with a stunt you perform with the SP you gain. Unfortunately, your stunt cannot achieve your original intended action. The GM determines if the desired stunt is permitted, based on the situation.\n\nInspire\nYour words and presence motivate others to action. The benefits of Inspire do not stack, if you happen to have multiple characters on the same side who have it, other than their ability to continue inspiring their side after one or more of them has been taken out.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nCommunication 2 or higher\n\nNovice\nYou inspire your friends and allies. If you are conscious and they are within sight of you, your allies gain a +1 bonus to all Willpower-related tests.\n\nExpert\nYou inspire greatness in your friends and allies. If you are conscious and they are within sight of you, any ally generating stunt points gains +1 SP.\n\nMaster\nWith you around, things don’t seem quite as bad. Once per encounter, you can spend two minor actions to offer words of inspiration to your allies. All who hear these words regain 1d6 + your Communication in Fortune, and receive a +2 bonus on their next test.\n\nIntrigue\nYou are a master of secrets.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nCommunication 2 or higher\n\nNovice\nYou understand how to navigate complex social situations. Choose one of the following Communication focuses: Deception, Etiquette, or Seduction. If you fail a Communication test with your chosen focus, you can re-roll it but must keep the result of the second roll.\n\nExpert\nYou can squeeze information from the most reluctant sources. If the focus you chose in the Novice degree is considered a tangential focus during an investigation (see Chapter 5), you ignore the +2 increase to the TN of the test. In addition, if you use the focus you chose in the Novice degree to successfully complete a task in a complex social interaction, you clear two shifts instead of only one.\n\nMaster\nThe secrets you know can raise or ruin anyone’s good standing. You can perform the Cast Out and Oozing Confidence social stunts for 1 SP lower than their normal cost. In addition, you can use Oozing Confidence to benefit another character.\n\nKnow-it-all\nYou can bring your considerable knowledge to bear on any situation.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nIntelligence 2 or higher\n\nNovice\nYou can attempt a test using an Intelligence focus somehow related to the test at hand rather than the called for ability, but with a –1 penalty. For example, using Intelligence (Business) instead of Communication (Persuasion) to convince a corporate middle-manager to agree with you. If this would be a tangential investigation focus, you do not suffer the +2 increase in TN.\n\nExpert\nYou leverage every bit of information. You can perform the Breakthrough exploration stunt for 2 SP.\n\nMaster\nWhen you succeed at an ability test with a knowledge focus, you gain a +1 bonus to the result of each Drama Die on tests using related focuses for the duration of the encounter. For example, an Intelligence (Law) test can benefit Communication (Oratory) tests in a courtroom, or an Intelligence (Medicine) test can benefit a Perception (Intuition) test in a diagnosis.\n\nKnowledge\nYou have an inquisitive mind and you’re a fast learner.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nIntelligence 2 or higher\n\nNovice\nWhen you make a successful Intelligence test with a knowledge focus, the GM should give you an extra piece of information on the topic. A knowledge focus is any Intelligence focus with a description that starts with “Knowledge”, such as Business or Science. The GM determines the nature of the additional information and it may or may not be pertinent to the main question at hand.\n\nExpert\nWhen making Intelligence (Research) tests as part of an advanced test, you gain a +1 bonus to the result of each Drama Die. See Advanced Tests in Chapter 1 for details.\n\nMaster\nPick any two of your knowledge focuses. When making tests using those focuses, you can re-roll a failed test but must keep the result of the second roll.\n\nLinguistics\nYou pick up new languages easily. When you learn a new language, you learn to both speak and read it.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nIntelligence 1 or higher\n\nNovice\nYou learn an additional language.\n\nExpert\nYou learn two additional languages for a total of three plus your native language(s). You can also imitate a specific dialect with a successful Communication (Performance) test.\n\nMaster\nYou learn three additional languages for a total of six plus your native language(s). You can also pick any one additional language you know and speak it like a native—that is, without any trace of an accent.\n\nMaker\nMake-it-yourself is your motto and you use manufacturing focuses to do just that. Use Dexterity (Craft) for most hand crafted and artistic items and Intelligence (Engineering) for most technological items. The GM may approve other manufacturing focuses as appropriate for certain items.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nAny manufacturing focus (see below)\n\nNovice\nYou can use a manufacturing focus to make any item with the appropriate tools and access to a work shop. See Make or Repair under Interludes in Chapter 5 for details.\n\nExpert\nYour workmanship is reliable and steady. If you fail a test with a manufacturing focus, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll.\n\nMaster\nWhen you perform an advanced test with a manufacturing focus, you gain a +1 bonus to the result of each Drama Die for the purpose of reaching the success threshold.\n\nMedic\nYou can treat certain conditions in the field. See Conditions in Chapter 1 for details.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nIntelligence 1 or higher\n\nNovice\nYour treatment allows a patient to add your Intelligence (and Medicine focus, if any) to a test to avoid or overcome a medical hazard, or grants the patient a new test to overcome that hazard, if there is one. This includes saving a patient from dying and reviving an unconscious character.\n\nExpert\nIf you treat a patient, you can alleviate the effects of the exhausted, fatigued, injured, or wounded conditions. This takes an advanced TN 11 Intelligence (Medicine) test (threshold 5) with each roll taking one minute. If you succeed, the patient ignores the effects of those conditions for 1d6 hours. The conditions are still present, however, and the effects return when the duration ends or if any of the conditions worsen, such as an injured character becoming wounded, for example.\n\nMaster\nYou can quickly treat wounds to prevent them from becoming serious. If you treat a wounded condition within an hour of it occurring, you can make a basic TN 13 Intelligence (Medicine) test. Success down grades the wounded condition to injured.\n\nMisdirection\nYou can sow confusion among friends and foes alike.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nCommunication (Deception) focus\n\nNovice\nAs a major action, you can make a Communication (Deception) test opposed by an opponent’s Will power (Self-Discipline); if you succeed, your opponent cannot perform stunts until the end of your next turn.\n\nExpert\nYour targets become too focused on you to do anything else. When you use the Over Here! exploration stunt, the bonus your allies gain is +2 instead of +1, and you gain a +1 bonus yourself.\n\nMaster\nWhen you use a Communication focus in combat and roll doubles, you gain +1 SP.\n\nObservation\nYou have an eye for detail.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nPerception 2 or higher\n\nNovice\nYou notice things others do not. Choose a Perception focus. If you fail a Perception test with your chosen focus, you can re-roll it but must keep the result of the second roll\n\nExpert\nAnalysis of your observation often leads to insight. On a successful Perception test, you can spend 2 SP to make a second, immediate Perception test with the same TN but with a different focus than the first, and gain additional information (if any) from a successful test with the second focus. This includes additional information when you uncover the clue within a lead.\n\nMaster\nNothing escapes your scrutiny. On a successful Perception test, you can spend 2 SP and gain a +2 bonus to all Perception tests involving the same object or subject as the first test for the duration of the encounter.\n\nOratory\nYou are a skilled public speaker who can sway others with your words.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nCommunication (Persuasion) focus\n\nNovice\nYou know how to work a crowd. If you fail a Communication (Persuasion) test when trying to convince a group (not an individual), you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll.\n\nExpert\nEach time you perform the Sway the Crowd social stunt, you affect three additional people instead of one.\n\nMaster\nYou can agitate a crowd. If you make a successful Communication (Persuasion) test when addressing a group and the result of your Drama Die is 5 or 6, you rouse them to immediate action. You can’t necessarily control what they do, though you can try to do so with Communication (Leadership) tests, but they take your words to heart and act on them regardless.\n\nPerformance\nYou have a talent for the performing arts.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nCommunication (Performing) focus\n\nNovice\nChoose a form of performance art, such as playing a musical instrument, singing, acting, dancing, miming, stand-up comedy, juggling, or any other art performed in front of an audience. You are an accomplished performer in your chosen art. In addition, you may perform the From the Heart and Sway the Crowd stunts for 1 SP less than their normal cost.\n\nExpert\nYou can add an additional form of performance. You get a feel for a room and adapt accordingly. If you have at least 15 minutes to observe a crowd before performing or speaking in front of them, you gain a +1 bonus to any Communication-based tests to persuade or entertain them. You can also choose a number of individuals in the crowd equal to your Perception (minimum 1); at the end of the 15 minutes of observation you know their initial attitudes toward you, and you know if they changed by the end of your performance and, if so, by how much.\n\nMaster\nYou can add an additional form of perfor mance to your repertoire. When performing, you exude confidence and style. You may perform the With a Flourish stunt while performing in front of an audience for 3 SP, and its effects last until the end of the day.\n\nPilot\nAny vehicle under your control becomes like an extension of yourself.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nDexterity (Driving or Piloting) focus\n\nNovice\nYou are quick to get things going. Starting up a vehicle is a free action for you, and you can perform Dexterity (Driving or Piloting) tests as a minor action.\n\nExpert\nYou push the performance of your means of transportation. When you control a vehicle, it gains a +2 bonus to tests involving its speed.\n\nMaster\nIf you fail an ability test to control a vehicle, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll. In addition, while you are at the controls, your vehicle gains a +2 bonus to Defence as long as it is moving.\n\nPinpoint Accuracy\nIf you can see it, you can hit it. Hard.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nAccuracy or Fighting 1 or higher, and Dexterity 1 or higher\n\nNovice\nYou strike where it hurts the most. Once per round, you can add 1d6 to the damage of a successful attack if your Dexterity is greater than your target’s.\n\nExpert\nYour instinct is as sharp as your eyes. When you take the Aim action, the attack bonus you gain is +2 instead of +1.\n\nMaster\nYou can perform the Called Shot action stunt for 3 SP. You can also use it with any weapon, not just guns.\n\nProtector\nYou are the shield that protects your friends.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nPerception and Willpower 1 or higher\n\nNovice\nYour desire to protect others lends you speed. When you perform the Blockade action stunt, you can move up to 6 meters instead of 3.\n\nExpert\nYou react quickly to put yourself in harm’s way. When you perform the Guardian Angel action stunt, the amount of damage you take instead of your ally is equal to the number of SP spent +2.\n\nMaster\nYou become the shadow of those who would hurt others. If you are standing next to an oppo nent and that opponent moves within 2 meters of one of your allies, you can move adjacent to the opponent before they finish their turn, even if it would surpass your Speed. Your Speed is 0 on your next turn.\n\nQuick Reflexes\nYou react to threats instantly and instinctually.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nDexterity 2 or higher\n\nNovice\nYou can prepare for action in an instant. Once per round on your turn you can use Ready as a free action.\n\nExpert\nYou can go prone or stand up as a free action rather than as part of a Move action.\n\nMaster\nIt is hard to get the drop on you. You may re-roll your initiative roll at the start of a combat encounter, but must keep the results of the second roll.\n\nScouting\nYou are skilled in reconnaissance and infiltration.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nDexterity 2 or higher\n\nNovice\nIf you fail a Dexterity (Stealth) test, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll.\n\nExpert\nYou know how to get the drop on opponents. You can perform the Seize the Initiative stunt for 2 SP.\n\nMaster\nYou are a skilled observer. If you fail a Perception (Seeing) test, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll.\n\nTactical Awareness\nYou move calmly and expertly while in combat.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nDexterity and Perception 1 or higher\n\nNovice\nYou can take the Melee Attack or Ranged Attack action at any point during your movement. Normally you have to finish your movement before attacking.\n\nExpert\nYou seem to have eyes in the back of your head. When you perform the Take One for the Team exploration stunt, you only take half the damage from a trap or hazard and your ally remains unscathed.\n\nMaster\nYou are hard to pin down in combat. Opponents do not gain an attack bonus for outnumbering you in melee. If you also have the Expert degree in the Single Weapon Style, your Defence bonus increases to +3 when fighting in that style.\n\nFighting Styles\nDual Weapon Style\nYou can fight in hand-to-hand combat with a weapon in your primary hand and another in your off-hand (a secondary weapon). Unless otherwise stated, attacks come from the primary weapon.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nDexterity 2 or higher\n\nNovice\nWhile wielding two close combat weapons, if you take the Activate action, you gain either a +1 bonus on your melee attack rolls or a +1 Defence bonus vs. melee attacks until the end of the encounter. You can switch the bonus with another Activate action.\n\nExpert\nYou can perform the Lightning Attack stunt for 2 SP instead of the usual 3, but the extra attack must come from your secondary weapon.\n\nMaster\nYou can overwhelm opponents with attacks from both weapons. If you make a Melee Attack with your primary weapon and you are not charging, you can make another attack with your secondary weapon as a minor action. The second attack cannot generate stunt points, and you only add half of your Strength (rounded down) to damage.\n\nGrappling Style\nYou’re skilled in restraining and subduing opponents in unarmed combat.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nFighting (Grappling) focus\n\nNovice\nIf you fail an opposed Fighting (Grappling) test to avoid being grappled, as per the Grapple stunt’s description in Chapter 5, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll.\n\nExpert\nIf you successfully hit an opponent with an unarmed attack and choose a stunt from the Grappling category, you gain 1 additional SP to apply.\n\nMaster\nYou can perform the Pin stunt for 3 SP instead of the usual 4. In addition, your penalty to Defence when using the Grapple and Pin stunts is halved.\n\nOverwhelm Style\nIn hand-to-hand combat, you are relentless and over whelming.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nFighting 2 or higher\n\nNovice\nWhen you make a close combat attack, you can take up to a –3 penalty on your attack roll to receive a corresponding bonus to your damage roll.\n\nExpert\nYour expertise makes you dangerous. When you succeed with a close combat attack, you can add your focus bonus for that attack to your damage total.\n\nMaster\nYou break opponent’s defences with brutal or relentless attacks. If you spend 3 SP after a successful attack, your target must make an opposed Strength (Might) test against your attack roll; if they fail, they suffer a –2 penalty to Defence until the end of your next turn.\n\nPistol Style\nBetween the quick and the dead, you prefer the former.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nAccuracy (Pistols) focus\n\nNovice\nYou are deadlier close-up. You gain a +1 bonus to damage with pistols against targets within 6 meters.\n\nExpert\nIf you have a pistol in your hand, or draw or grab one as your first available action, you can roll initiative with an Accuracy (Pistols) test instead of a Dexterity (Initiative) test. You can also generate stunt points with this test, unlike a normal initiative roll, and spend them on general combat or gun stunts.\n\nMaster\nWhen hitting a target with a shot from a pistol, you can add your Dexterity to the damage total.\n\nRifle Style\nA rifle is far more dangerous in your hands.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nAccuracy (Rifles) focus\n\nNovice\nYou can assume a highly ready stance; as long as you are not moving more than half your normal speed, you can make an attack with a loaded rifle you are holding as a reaction before rolling initiative, even if surprised. This attack uses up your major action for the round, which means that you only have a minor action available during your next turn.\n\nExpert\nYou ignore 2 points of any armour bonus provided by cover when using a longarm or assault rifle. When using those weapons, you also ignore the attack roll penalty imposed by the Human Shield action stunt.\n\nMaster\nPenalties to the attack roll due to range do not apply to your attacks with a rifle.\n\nSelf-defence Style\nYou are trained in martial arts focused on defence and deflection.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nFighting (Brawling) focus\n\nNovice\nYou use your opponent’s momentum against them. When a melee attack misses you, you can use the Grapple action stunt as a reaction without spending any SP. In addition, you can perform the Knock Prone action stunt for 1 SP instead of the usual 2 against an opponent you have grappled.\n\nExpert\nYour grip is difficult to break. If you fail a Fighting (Grappling) test, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll.\n\nMaster\nYou counter an opponent with grace and skill. When you perform the Disarm stunt, you can retain hold of the weapon. In addition, when you spend SP on Knock Prone after making a Fighting (Grappling) attack, you may automatically move your opponent 2 yards for no additional SP cost. You may increase this distance with the Skirmish stunt. The enemy falls prone after being moved.\n\nSingle Weapon Style\nYou can fight more effectively wielding a single-handed melee weapon.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nPerception 2 or higher\n\nNovice\nFighting with a single-handed weapon demands increased awareness. If you take the Activate action, you gain a +1 Defence bonus until the end of the encounter while fighting in this style.\n\nExpert\nYou can wield your weapon to block and parry attacks. Your bonus to Defence increases to +2 while fighting in this style.\n\nMaster\nYou know how to fight several enemies at once. Opponents making melee attacks against you never gain a bonus on their attack rolls for outnumbering you.\n\nStriking Style\nBy training or raw talent, your unarmed strikes leave a lasting impression.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nBy training or raw talent, your unarmed strikes leave a lasting impression.\n\nNovice\nWhen you attack unarmed, you inflict 1d6 damage instead of 1d3.\n\nExpert\nYour punch can drop the toughest oppo nents. You can perform the Knock Prone stunt for 1 SP when attacking unarmed.\n\nMaster\nYou can perform the Injure or Vicious Blow action stunts for 1 SP when attacking unarmed.\n\nThrown Weapon Style\nYou are adept with weapons thrown by hand.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nNone\n\nNovice\nYou gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls with thrown weapons.\n\nExpert\nYou can Ready a throwing weapon or grenade as a free action instead of a minor action.\n\nMaster\nAdd your Accuracy score in meters to the range of throwing weapons and grenades when you throw them.\n\nTwo-handed Style\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirements\nStrength 3 or higher and Fighting 1 or higher\n\nNovice\nYour weapon and the power of your attacks force foes to yield ground. When you hit with a melee attack with a heavy weapon, you can move the target 2 meters in any direction like the Skirmish stunt.\n\nExpert\nYou strike fearsome blows with your weapon. You can perform the Vicious Blow stunt for 1 SP when wielding a heavy weapon.\n\nMaster\nYou and your weapon are as one. When you are wielding a heavy weapon and gain SP, you gain +2 SP to use exclusively for the following stunts: Expose, Knock Prone, Shock and Awe, Skirmish, and Wound",
