		"content": "A Campaign for The Expanse RPG\n“The Belt bleeds, and the Inners sip champagne on Titan.”\nSix months have passed since Eros burned across the system and plunged into Venus. The stars haven’t looked right since.\nThe UN and the MCRN point guns at each other while retreating from their outposts in the Belt, leaving behind a power vacuum—and an opportunity. On Ceres, Anderson Dawes is calling for Belters to stand for themselves, to protect their own from pirates, criminals, and the vultures that circle in corporate suits.\nYou are a crew of freelancers, survivors, and exiles drawn into a fragile alliance under Dawes’ watchful eye. You’ve been asked to do what the Inners never would: look after your own. Enforce justice in a place where the laws are written in dust. You’ll root out smugglers, uncover hidden agendas, and tangle with black-budget ghosts that should have stayed buried.\nAnd somewhere in the dark, something is stirring—something colder than vacuum, and older than Mars.\nThis is Diomedes’ Spear—a story of loyalty, betrayal, and survival in a solar system coming apart at the seams.\nBuckle in, tolowda. Time to choose who you bleed for.",

		"content": "In The Expanse Roleplaying Game, character bonds are a crucial aspect of interpersonal connections, representing the intimate ties that form between Player Characters (PCs) and even between PCs and their ship. These relationships can be deliberately developed or arise from circumstances.\nNature of the Bond (Relationship Bond)\n\nThe &quot;Relationship Bond&quot; defines the specific nature of the connection between characters, such as friendship, animosity, or romance.\nBonds can range from straightforward to highly complex.\nExamples of such bonds include statements like: &quot;I would risk my life for you,&quot; &quot;I won't stop until you are dead,&quot; &quot;We've gone through hell together,&quot; &quot;I trust you to be my conscience,&quot; and &quot;You are someone I love and respect, but we can never be together in the way I want&quot;.\nBoth the Game Master (GM) and players should understand the foundation of a Bond and track its evolution over time.\n\nStrength of the Bond (Relationship Intensity)\n\nBeyond its nature, a bond also has an Intensity rating, from 1 to 5, which signifies its strength .\nAn Intensity of 1 denotes a new but significant relationship, while an Intensity of 5 represents a profound, once-in-a-lifetime connection.\nMechanical Benefit: For each rank of Intensity, a character receives a free stunt point (SP) at the start of each game session. These SP can only be used for stunts that directly involve or are connected to the relationship, and can only be spent once per session. They can be combined with SP generated from rolling doubles.\n\nFormation and Evolution of Bonds\n\nIdeally, relationships and bonds should form organically during play, developing from character interactions.\nDuring character creation, players can establish initial connections by choosing &quot;Ties&quot; to other group members, promoting early group cohesion.\nCharacters can actively work to forge new bonds or modify existing ones by performing the &quot;Relating&quot; interlude activity. This activity requires time and a willing participant, or circumstances that necessitate it.\nIntensity can change over time, waxing or waning. Players and GMs should review relationships when a character gains a level to decide if the Bond type or Intensity shifts. Increasing Intensity by one step typically requires a number of interludes equal to the desired Intensity level.\n\nShip Bonds\n\nBeyond character-to-character relationships, ships can also form bonds with their crew members. This is often a deeply personal and absolute connection, as the crew relies on the ship for survival in space.\nLike character relationships, Ship Bonds are described from the character's perspective and guide the tone of their interactions with the vessel.\nShip Bonds also have an Intensity rating (1 to 5), with each rank granting a free stunt point exclusively for stunts related to the ship.\nThese bonds can be increased or forged by undertaking &quot;Maintenance&quot; or &quot;Making or Fixing&quot; activities during an interlude, or by crews spending time &quot;Relating&quot; on the ship.\nWhile Ship Bond Intensity can decrease if a character spends a significant amount of time away from the vessel, it can never drop below 1 unless the ship is destroyed.",

		"content": "Outsider\nMore of a non-social class, outsiders tend to be outcasts, criminals, or non-conformists who can’t or won’t live according to society’s customs. They often lack access to things other people take for granted and learn to get by on their own, some times forming their own support networks and structures outside of those of mainstream society. Some outsiders reject the mainstream by choice, but in many cases, outsiders are pushed out by society’s biases.\nLower Class\nHard, usually physical, labour and precarious employment tend to rule the lives of lower class characters. Still, that work is often all that separates them from becoming outsiders, so they cling to it. Lower class characters often depend on family and friends to help keep them out of utter poverty. They might live in failing industrial areas, inner city slums, or hardscrabble farms. In all cases, they make do with what is available and find ways to stretch out resources until the next payday or job comes along\nMiddle Class\nA measure of comfort and security comes with the middle class. A steady job, often skilled labour or “white collar,” supplies the means to afford a few luxuries or non-essentials. Middle class characters might start off as a bit insular. They often separate themselves from the struggles of the lower social classes, focusing on the climb towards upper class status. Sometimes that climb leads to a slip. They tumble down to the lower class or even become outsiders. Some settle for stability instead, and prefer not to rock the boat.\nUpper Class\nUpper class characters sit at a society’s summit where they rarely need to worry about resources, except, of course, when they want more. Their concerns are often focused on the responsibilities and privileges associated with their status. Some are born into upper class privilege, inheriting wealth and opportunity, while others worked their way up to join the elite. In some societies, it’s almost impossible to work your way to upper class status, and even if you do, you might get less respect compared to hereditary “old money” peers.",

		"url":"/diomedes-spear/rules/combat-actions/",
		"content": "Major Actions\n\nAction\nDetails\n\nAll-out Attack\nYou attack one adjacent enemy in close combat, throwing the full force of your Strength behind the attack at the cost of your ability to defend yourself. If your attack hits, you do +1 damage, but whether or not the attack hits, you have a –1 to your Defence until the start of your next turn.\n\nCharge\nYou move up to half your Speed (rounded down) in meters and finish with a close combat attack against an adjacent enemy. If you moved at least 4 meters in a straight line before reaching your target, you gain a +1 bonus on your attack roll. You cannot take this action if you are prone (you’d need to use the Move action to stand up first).\n\nDefend\nYou focus on defending yourself. Until the start of your next turn, you gain a +2 bonus to your Defence.\n\nMelee Attack\nYou attack an enemy within 2 meters of you in hand-to-hand combat (see Making Attacks).\n\nRanged Attack\nYou fire or throw a ranged weapon at one visible enemy within range (see Making Attacks).\n\nRun\nYou move up to twice your Speed in meters, sacrificing the ability to perform another action so you can move farther. You cannot take this action if you are prone (you’d need to use the Move minor action to stand up first).\n\nStunt Attack\nInstead of trying to damage an opponent, you focus on performing a specific action stunt, like subduing an enemy with a hold instead of hurting them (a Grapple stunt). Roll an attack test as usual. A successful test awards you 1 SP of a type appropriate for the attack, but the attack itself inflicts no damage. If you roll doubles, you earn additional SP as normal and may choose a stunt that damages your opponent, but there is still no damage from the base attack. You can attempt stunt attacks against objects as well as opponents, though the GM may rule that some stunts do not apply.\n\nMinor Actions\n\nAction\nDetails\n\nActivate\nThis action allows you to start using certain abilities or items, such as certain talents or technology.\n\nAim\nYou take the measure of your opponent and plan your next strike. If your next action after Aim is a melee or ranged attack, you gain a +1 bonus on your attack roll.\n\nGuard Up\nYou balance action and defense. Add +1 or +2 (your choice) to your Defense until the end of the round. However, the same modifier becomes a penalty to all tests you make, even opposed tests, until the end of the round as well (unlike the Defend action, which lasts until the beginning of your next turn). If you choose this minor action, you must do it before any major action on your turn, and you cannot Defend on the same turn.\n\nMove\nYou move up to your Speed in meters and can combine this with actions like dropping prone, standing up, or climbing into a vehicle, but each of these types of actions consumes half your Speed (rounded down).\n\nPrepare\nWhen you take this action, you postpone your major action. You declare one major action and your choice to Prepare it. After you do so, the next person in the initiative order acts, and so on, but at any time until the beginning of your next turn, you can interrupt another character and take your prepared action immediately. If you don’t use the prepared action by your next turn, you lose it.\n\nPress the Attack\nYou stand ready to pursue an enemy if they fall back or flee. You can take this action after successfully striking an enemy target with a melee attack (whether you inflict damage or not). After you declare this action, if that foe moves away from you, you may immediately move up to your Speed in meters in direct pursuit at no additional cost in actions. This occurs immediately after your foe’s movement, before they can do anything else.\n\nReady\nYou draw a weapon, pull out a device, or otherwise ready a stowed item. As part of this action, you can put away something already in hand. You could holster a pistol and pull out a grenade with the same Ready action, for example.\n\nStand Firm\nYou stand firm and prepare to resist any effort to move you. Until the start of your next turn, any enemy using the Skirmish or Knock Prone stunts to move you or knock you to the ground must succeed in an opposed test of their Strength (Might) against your choice of your own Strength (Might) or Dexterity (Acrobatics). If you win the test, the attempt fails. If the attacker wins, the attempt proceeds normally. The attacker still spends the stunt points, regardless of whether the attempt to move you succeeds or fails.\n\nAttack Roll Modifiers\n\nModifier\nCircumstance\n\n-5\nAttacker is blind or otherwise completely unable to see the target.\n\n-3\nDefender in heavy cover, such as a building or stone wall. Melee attacker in heavy snow.\n\n-2\nDefender in light cover, such as a hedge or the woods. Melee attacker in the mud. Ranged attack vs. defender engaged in melee combat. Combat at night.\n\n-1\nRain, mist, or smoke obscures the defender. Combat in low light conditions.\n\n0\nNormal circumstances.\n\n+1\nAttacker is on higher ground. Defender is prone. Melee attacker and allies outnumber defender 2 to 1.\n\n+2\nMelee attacker and allies outnumber defender 3 to 1. Defender is drunk.\n\n+3\nDefender is unaware of the attack.\n\nMorale Tests\nCharacters who fail a Willpower (Morale) test attempt to break off from combat or even surrender.\nConditions triggering a morale test:\n\nWhen more than half of the side’s combatants are taken out of the fight\nWhen the side’s leader or champion is taken out of the fight\nWhen fighting on will clearly mean being trapped or surrounded\nWhen the other side reveals a serious or over whelming advantage\nWhen they fail an opposed TN15 Persuasion test.",

The character can only move with access to hand-holds, a surface to push off from, or some type of thrust (like from a thruster pack) and, once moving, continues to move with the same speed and trajectory unless acted upon to stop or change their movement.\n\nHindered\nThe character’s Speed is halved (round down) and they cannot take the Charge or Run actions.\n\nProne\nThe character is lying on the ground. The character cannot take the Charge or Run actions, as they can only move by crawling, and standing up from prone requires a Move action using half the character’s Speed. Melee attacks have a +1 bonus against prone characters, while ranged attacks have a –1 penalty.\n\nRestrained\nThe character’s Speed becomes 0 and they effectively cannot move. A restrained condition may prevent a character from taking certain other actions as well, defined by the nature of the restraint.\n\nHealth\n\nName\nEffect\n\nInjured\nThe character is hurt. The character has a –1 penalty to all tests and is fatigued, unable to take the Charge or Run actions. An injured character who receives an additional injured condition becomes wounded.\n\nWounded\nThe character is severely injured. The character has a –2 penalty to all tests and is exhausted, their Speed halved and unable to take the Charge or Run actions. A wounded character who receives an additional injured or wounded condition becomes dying.\n\nDying\nThe character is in danger of perishing. A dying character loses 1 point of Constitution score each round on the start of the character’s turn. When the character’s Constitution score reaches –3, the character dies. Successful first aid applied to a dying character stabilizes their condition, making them helpless, unconscious, and wounded instead. They must recover from these conditions normally (see Interludes in Chapter 5).\n\nHelpless\nThe character is incapable of doing anything. The character cannot take any actions.\n\nUnconscious\nThe character is unaware of their surroundings or the passage of time. The character falls prone and is helpless, unable to take any actions.\n\nStamina\n\nName\nEffect\n\nFatigued\nThe character is tired and cannot take the Charge or Run actions. A fatigued character who receives an additional fatigued condition becomes exhausted.\n\nExhausted\nThe character is severely fatigued. The character’s Speed is halved and they cannot take the Charge or Run actions. An exhausted character who receives an additional fatigued or exhausted condition becomes helpless.\n\nHelpless\nThe character is incapable of doing anything. The character cannot take any actions.",

		"content": "Each quality -&gt; cost +1\nEach flaw -&gt; cost - 1\nGeneral Qualities\n\nQuality\nEffect\n\nDurable\nThe item is built to last. Under normal conditions, it lasts twice as long and for tests involving damaging it, it has +2 Toughness.\n\nEffective\nThe item works better than a regular item of its type, gaining a +1 bonus to one of its abilities. This could be damage, armour bonus, or some other ability used for outcome or effectiveness but not for tests (see Fine, following, for that quality) or a 50% improvement in overall output. A Very Effective item has two qualities and provides a +2 bonus or a 100% improvement.\n\nFast\nThe item works fast. It takes half the usual time to use a regular item of its type. For something used during action time, the character gains a +2 bonus to initiative when using the item\n\nFavoured Stunt\nThe item is either especially well-suited for performing a particular stunt, granting a –1 SP modifier to its cost, or else the item grants access to a unique stunt the character can perform while wielding or using it. Each favoured stunt is a separate quality and an item can have more than one.\n\nFine\nThe item’s quality is such that the character gains a +1 bonus to tests for using or wielding it. Very Fine items have two qualities and provide a +2 bonus.\n\nImpressive\nThe item’s quality is clearly apparent, providing a +1 bonus to social and roleplaying tests where such things are noteworthy, such as trying to make a good impression while wearing an Impressive outfit or intimidating someone with an Impressive weapon. Very Impressive items have two qualities and provide a +2 bonus.\n\nLight\nThe item is lighter and more compact than normal, reducing any penalty to Dexterity and Speed it normally imposes by 1. Very Light items have two qualities and reduce penalties by 2.\n\nGeneral Flaws\n\nFlaw\nEffect\n\nFragile\nThe item wasn’t made to take much punishment. A deliberate attempt to break it always succeeds. Further more, when a test to use the item fails and the Drama Die is 3 or less, the item breaks.\n\nHeavy\nThe item is heavier or bulkier than normal, imposing a –1 penalty to the Dexterity and Speed of a character carrying or wearing it. Very Heavy items have two flaws and impose a –2 penalty to Dexterity and Speed.\n\nIneffective\nThe item can’t inflict damage as easily as a proper weapon, imposing a –1 or –2 penalty to damage rolls, with a minimum damage roll of 1.\n\nPoor\nThe overall poor quality of the item imposes a –1 penalty to tests using or wielding it. Very Poor items have two flaws and impose a –2 penalty.\n\nShoddy\nThe item’s flaws are glaringly apparent, imposing a –1 penalty to social and roleplaying tests where such things are noteworthy, such as trying to intimidate someone with a Shoddy weapon, or make a good first impression in a Shoddy outfit. The GM may adjust the penalty, depending on the circumstances, but it is always negative.\n\nSlow\nThe item works, but not fast. It takes twice as much time to use as a regular item of its type. For something that can be used with a major action during action time, a Slow item requires a Ready action after it is used each time to prepare it to be used again.\n\nUnreliable\nThe item works...most of the time. When a test involving the item fails and the Drama Die is a 3 or less, the item stops working. If the item does not require a test to use, the GM should roll 3d6 when the item needs to work. On a total roll of 10 or less where the Drama Die is a 3 or less, the item stops working. Getting an Unreliable item working again takes either an interlude to fix it or, during action time, a TN 13 challenge test with a success threshold of 10 and a time increment of 1 round.\n\nRanged Weapon Qualities\n\nQuality\nEffect\n\nArmor Piercing\nThe weapon’s rounds reduce the Toughness bonus of worn armour by –2 in terms of reducing their damage. Unfortunately, armour-piercing rounds also have the ability to punch through vacuum sealed bulkheads, so a missed attack with one on a spaceship or station near an outside wall may cause a hull breach. Roll 1d6; on a roll of 1 or 2, a breach occurs and the air begins rushing out of the compartment. See the Threats chapter for details on suffocation hazards\n\nAutomatic\nThe weapon reloads and fires automatically so long as its trigger is depressed. This makes the weapon capable of performing stunts with the (Automatic) quality on the Gun Stunts table in Chapter 5.\n\nHigh Capacity\nThe weapon carries a substantial amount of ammunition. Ignore the first roll indicating the weapon has run out of ammo (see Weapon Capacity, following).\n\nLong Range\nThe weapon’s effective ranges are doubled. See Range under Making Attacks in Chapter 5 for details.\n\nSpreading\nThe weapon fires a spreading cone of pellets, shot, or similar small ammunition, like a shotgun. It does one die less damage, but can hit all targets within a roughly 30-degree angle in front of the shooter.\n\nTracer\nThe weapon fires rounds that glow, leaving visible trails (tracers) behind. A tracer weapon allows the user to take the Aim action as a free action so long as the weapon was fired on the previous round (see Aim under Minor Actions in Chapter 5).\n\nTranquilizer\nA tranquilizer or tranq weapon fires a hypodermic dart preloaded with a dose of a drug, usually a powerful tranquilizer to knock out its target. The dart won’t penetrate any armour, but if it hits an unarmoured target, the character must make a TN 13 Constitution (Tolerance) test or become unconscious. A successful test means the character is only fatigued.\n\nMakeshift Weapon Flaws\n\nFlaw\nEffect\n\nClumsy\nThe weapon is awkward to wield, imposing a –1 or –2 penalty to attack tests.\n\nFragile\nThe weapon wasn’t made to take much punishment. When an attack with it misses and the Drama Die is 3 or less, the object breaks and becomes useless as a weapon\n\nWeak\nThe object can’t inflict damage as easily as a proper weapon, imposing a –1 or –2 penalty to damage rolls, with a minimum damage roll of 1.",

		"url":"/diomedes-spear/rules/honorifics/",
		"content": "Honorifics are titles or nicknames that a character or a ship earns, representing their reputation within the world of The Expanse Roleplaying Game . They are a form of reward that characters gain for their deeds, or even simply due to rumours about them.\nPurpose and Nature\n\nPublic Standing: Honorifics measure a character's or ship's public standing . For bounty hunters, reputation is crucial for attracting clients, while a poor reputation can make finding work difficult. Similarly, a planetary surveyor's or scout's reputation affects job offers, and for traders and smugglers, reputation is their &quot;lifeblood&quot;, influencing access to legitimate or high-risk jobs. An Entertainer can have VIP Access for their ship due to their celebrity status, reducing fees and repair times.\nInfluence and Access: They can be leveraged to smooth social interactions or gain access to resources and opportunities otherwise out of reach. For example, a journalist's press identifier broadcasts their credentials, flagging them as a non-combatant and reducing their chances of arrest or being shot.\nSituational: Honorifics are potent but situational. A champion athlete's fame in sports may not help in a political debate unless directly related. The GM has the final say on when an honorific applies mechanically.\nDynamic: They are rarely permanent and can fade or change based on conflicting evidence or new actions. They don't even need to be entirely deserved or true.\n\nGaining and Losing Honorifics\n\nAcquisition: Honorifics usually arise from a character's actions in play. Characters can choose a reputation (honorific) as an improvement from their character's drive during creation.\nMaintenance/Change: Characters can spend time during interludes performing the &quot;Reputation&quot; activity to bolster, diminish, or create a new honorific. This often involves making their actions known, such as giving interviews or broadcasting videos. The GM decides when a character has done enough to gain or lose a specific reputation; System-wide notoriety might require more than a few interludes to influence .\nAbility Test (Optional): A Game Master may require a Communication (Expression or Performing) test to measure the effectiveness of efforts to influence reputation.\n\nTypes of Honorifics and their Mechanical Effects\nHonorifics provide mechanical benefits, often tied to ability tests. Conversely, bad reputations reverse these benefits into penalties, and can be eliminated through &quot;Reputation&quot; interlude activities.\n\nPersonal Reputation: When a character invokes their honorific (or the story of how they gained it), opponents suffer a -1 penalty on opposed tests against them, particularly when the test involves the character's famed skill or natural ability.\n\nBad Personal Reputation: Opponents gain a +1 bonus on opposed tests.\n\nSupportive Reputation: When others (friends or foes) talk up a character's title, the character gains a +2 bonus to rolls demonstrating their known abilities in that scene.\n\nBad Supportive Reputation: Relevant test target numbers increase by +2 for the character.\n\nInspired Reputation: Using an honorific outside its typical field (an &quot;inspired purpose&quot;) grants a +1 bonus to the Drama Die result when the player demonstrates clever use of the honorific for an aim.\n\nBad Inspired Reputation: Tests in relevant areas suffer a -1 penalty to the stunt points generated on the Drama Die.\n\nPassive Reputation: In social situations where a group or individual is aware of the reputation, the character benefits from a free, single-step attitude shift (positive or negative) in the direction suited to their reputation.\n\nBad Passive Reputation: Tends to worsen attitudes and can lead to increased scrutiny from authorities.\n\nReputation Spread (RS)\nThe impact of a reputation is only meaningful if others have heard of it. Reputation Spread is a dynamic rating (0–5) that tracks how far your reputation has travelled across the system.\n\nRS\nSpread Level\nDescription\n\n0\nUnknown\nOnly your crew and direct contacts know of your actions. No mechanical effect.\n\n1\nLocal\nKnown within a station or small cluster (e.g., Ceres or Tycho).\n\n2\nRegional\nTalked about across an orbit (e.g., Belt or Inner Mars stations).\n\n3\nSystemic\nWhispers about your name float through multiple planetary zones.\n\n4\nFactional\nMajor factions track you, and your name is recognized by agents and contractors.\n\n5\nLegendary\nYour name is known across the entire system—loved, feared, or both.\n\nShip Honorifics\nShips, like characters, can also gain reputations and honorifics based on their history and their crew's collective actions. These can inspire respect or fear.\n\nShip honorifics have the same four categories (Personal, Supportive, Inspired, Passive) with similar mechanical effects as character honorifics.\nSome ship honorifics are historical facts, like a former name or captain, which might provide narrative flavour but no mechanical benefit or even a detriment.\n\nExamples of Honorifics\n\nThe Absolute: A paragon of a sub-culture or cause, beloved by allies and attacked by opponents. (e.g., Absolute Professional for Bounty Hunters)\nBane of the Belt: For those who crusade against pirates and OPA terrorists.\nChampion Athlete: A star in their chosen sport.\nDestined for Greatness: Character succeeds beyond expectations, creating rivals.\nExpert in the Field: Recognised for knowledge and achievements in a professional pursuit. (e.g., Expert Bounty Hunter, Expert Surveyor, Expert Scout, Expert Smuggler/Trader).\nLoyal: Known for sticking to friends or employers, even at personal cost.\nLucky: Things always seem to work out for them, but this breeds resentment.\nNatural Aptitude: Admired for innate ability rather than training.\nProtector of Innocents: Known for defending those who cannot defend themselves. (e.g., Protector of the Underdog for Bounty Hunters, Merciful for Pirates).\nSuperlative Lover: Known for romantic and sexual prowess and compassion.\nSurvivor: Has faced disasters and come through unscathed. (e.g., Sailed a Thousand Light Years for Pirates).\nTrue OPA: Seen as a loyal member of rebellious OPA factions. (e.g., Eyes of the OPA for Scouts).\nDeep Space Dweller: Spends more time in deep space than on planetary bodies.\nAll the Best Stuff: Focuses on delivering specific high-quality cargo.\nExpedited Deliverer: Known for speed in transport.\nZookeeper: Transports alien life-forms.\nOstentatious: A ship that draws attention wherever it goes, good for impressions but also a target for unsavoury types.",

When a character is not active within that organisation, their reputation will wane. Practically meaning that the character will drop one membership rank. This drop in rank can represent disapproval from organisation member or leadership, or even the effects of undermining by opposed factions within the organisation.\nWhen your character's in-game activities are not associated with the their organisation, they can remain active within that organisation by dedicating one interlude shift a week to advancement within the organisation. The activity within that shift can be varied, from responding to communications through to researching for them or providing them with information. I may be character initiated or come as a request from the organisation.\nArmed Combat Training Rules\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs desired\n\nEffect\nAccrue accuracy bonuses\n\nFocus\nAccuracy\n\nAlright, there isn't enough room for a shooting range, but luckily Mars solved that. There wasn't much sense in training all those Redboots then letting them go soft, so Mars developed a helmet based combat simulator that connects directly with weapons their Marine's weapons. Lucky for the rest of us, not all Martian are as patriotic as we are led to believe, and these simulators soon made their way onto the black market.\n\nWhen a character dedicates an interlude shift to armed combat training they can accrue accuracy bonuses. These bonuses can be spent to boost an accuracy roll by +2. Once a bonus is spent it is gone.\nCharacters roll a straight accuracy skill test against TN 13. If they pass, the drama die is the number of accuracy bonuses they have accrued.\nA character may perform this activity once in an interlude.\nAudit Rules\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nOnce a week\n\nEffect\n+2 to relevant rolls\n\nFocus\nN/A\n\nLiving in a little metal tube amidst the vastness of space can be challenging. You need to carry everything that you need with you. Importantly you also need to make sure that you actually have what you think you have. A crew member who is a 'midnight snacker' or 'liberal with the pain relief', a leaky water line, insufficient scrubbers, or a inaccurate ammunition counter can result in a discrepancy between what your records say you have, and what you actually have. This shortfall can have implication when resupplying, or, more consequentially, in times of crisis (eg. Churn Events, post-combat recovery).\n\nHaving a accurate understanding of your starting point mitigates complications. Having a recent stocktake (within one week) will grant a +2 to all rolls that relate to needing accurate records. For example, post combat and your ships reaction mass storage has been damaged. The pilot will receive a +2 to calculating manoeuvres so they ensure the reaction mass doesn't run out.\nCleaning Rules\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift per ability test in an Advance Test\n\nFrequency\nWhen required\n\nEffect\nRemoves the need for crew to perform challenge tests\n\nFocus\nConstitution (Tolerance)\n\nNormal cleaning is a day-to-day occurrence that doesn't need to be factored into interludes. This kind of clearing refers to the removal of pollutants or hazardous materials that spaceship carry around with them. Normally this material stays in it's appropriate locations and is removed as part of a resupply at docking facilities, but sometimes emergencies happen. If the pollutants or hazardous materials are not cleaned the crew will be at risk of developing conditions. They will requires Constitution (Tolerance) challenge tests, with consequences like increased difficulty or developing conditions\n\nThe cleaning of pollutants and hazardous materials is an advanced test, with the success threshold (ST) and the target number (TN) set by the GM. To make an ability test against the TN, one player will need to allocate an interlude shift to cleaning. If successful, they will add the drama die points to the accumulated progress towards the ST.\nIf an additional player wishes to assist, they too will have to allocate an interlude shift. If they succeed in a ability test towards against the TN, they add +2 to the cleaner's ability test.\nCommunication Rules\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift provides a calculated number of test\n\nFrequency\nWhen required\n\nEffect\nPerform communications ability tests\n\nFocus\nCommunication focus\n\nCommunicating over space distances is different to local communication. Even after just one day of 1/3g burn, there is a minute delay between a message being sent and it being received. Allowing for time spend composing, recording at returning a response, you would be unlikely to get a response earlier than five minutes. At that's close.

This complication means that any advanced form of communication (involving the communication focuses) is time consuming.\nTo engage in any form of communication test remotely, your character will need to allocate an interlude shift. The number of tests you character can perform in this shift, will depend on the distance of the communication.\nNumber of tests = 480mins / (Communication Distance + 10mins x 2)\nFor example, a character can perform 13 test if they are communication from Ceres to Tycho, but only 6 if they are communicating with someone in the Saturnian system.\nEquipment Adjustment Rules\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nMinimum of one interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs desired\n\nEffect\nPerform advanced engineering or technical tests towards equipment improvement\n\nFocus\nIntelligence (Engineering) or Intelligence (Technology)\n\nAdjusting equipment is essential in the variable, unpredictable environments of space where one-size-fits-all rarely applies. Vacuum seals wear unevenly, magnetic boots lose calibration, and tools designed for Martian gravity might fail under Belt micro-g. Belters tweak filters to stretch their lifespan; Martian marines modify armour seals to survive long burns. In tight ship quarters or aging stations, factory defaults aren't good enough -- tuning gear to your body, your task, and your environment keeps you alive. Whether it’s recalibrating a rifle’s zero for shipboard recoil, reinforcing an EVA suit for radiation, or jury-rigging a drone’s sensor array, adjustments make equipment personal, efficient, and reliable. During an Interlude, such adjustments justify mechanical bonuses and reflect the hard-earned lessons that separate spacers who just survive from those who thrive.\n\nAdjusting equipment by adding or removing attributes requires a player to perform an advanced technology or engineering test, using the Target numbers and success threshold below.\nThe equipment can only be worked on during interlude time, and each test expends one unit of interlude time.\nWhilst the equipment is being worked on, it is out of commission.\nSuccess Threshold\nThe success threshold required to add or remove on attribute.\n\nEquipment Type\nSuccess Threshold\n\nLight Close\n6\n\nHeavy Close\n7\n\nPistol\n10\n\nRifle\n12\n\nGrenade\n15\n\nPadded Armour\n8\n\nLight Armour\n12\n\nMedium Armour\n14\n\nHeavy Armour\n16\n\nRiot Shield\n13\n\nBallistic Shield\n14\n\nHand Terminal\n8\n\nHead-up Display\n10\n\nHUD Expert System\n12\n\nTerminals\n12\n\nTerminal Expert System\n14\n\nDrone\n14\n\nCombat Drone\n16\n\nButterfly Drone\n16\n\nGadfly Drone\n12\n\nCommunications Drone\n16\n\nDecoy Drone\n15\n\nDrone Augmentation\n20\n\nProbe\n17\n\nShoulder Mech\n15\n\nConstruction Mech\n15\n\nEnvironment Suit\n9\n\nVac Suit\n11\n\nForm-fitting Suit\n13\n\nTool Kit\n8\n\nWorkshop\n10\n\nBypass\n11\n\nRestraints\n7\n\nSedatives\n9\n\nElectronic Surveillance\n9\n\nPress ID\n6\n\nBurn Key\n10\n\nGhost in a Can\n14\n\nEMP Drill Hound\n14\n\nBoarding Wedge\n13\n\nPlumes of Io\n10\n\nShip Napping Expert Systems\n12\n\nShip Pathfinding Expert Systems\n15\n\nShip Pattern Searching Expert System\n20\n\nShip Scientific Analysis Expert System\n20\n\nTarget Numbers\nThe target number for each attribute.\n\nAttribute\nTarget number\n\nDurable\n17\n\nFragile\n17\n\nVery Effective\n19\n\nEffective\n17\n\nIneffective\n17\n\nVery Ineffective\n19\n\nFast\n17\n\nSlow\n17\n\nFavoured Stunt\n17\n\nVery Fine\n19\n\nFine\n17\n\nPoor\n17\n\nVery Poor\n19\n\nVery Impressive\n19\n\nImpressive\n17\n\nShoddy\n17\n\nVery Shoddy\n19\n\nUnreliable\n17\n\nArmour Piercing\n17\n\nTranquilizer\n17\n\nAutomatic\n17\n\nHigh Capacity\n17\n\nLong Range\n17\n\nSpreading\n17\n\nTracer\n17\n\nStunning\n17\n\nEquipment Maintenance Rules\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nOnce a week\n\nEffect\nPrevent equipment from developing flaws\n\nFocus\nN/A\n\nIn the harshness of space you need to be able to rely on your equipment. This means that every character knows how to maintain their equipment. Failure to maintain your equipment, means it will degrade. Character can prevent this by dedicating an interlude shift to maintain your equipment. The character will only require one shift to maintain all their personal equipment.\n\nFailure to maintain equipment\nIf a characters equipment has not been maintain in the past week, then the player has to roll on each equipment item (equipment being adjusted is excluded). If they roll a 1 2 or 3, that item will develop a random temporary flaw until. This flaw will be removed by it's next maintenance. The number of dice rolled is equal to the number of weeks it has been without maintenance (ie. after two weeks without maintenance, roll two dice).\n\nRoll\nTemporary Flaw\n\n1\nFragile\n\n2\nIneffective\n\n3\nVery Ineffective\n\n4\nSlow\n\n5\nPoor\n\n6\nVery Poor\n\n7\nShoddy\n\n8\nVery Shoddy\n\n9\nUnreliable\n\n10\nRoll again\n\nEquipment Manufacture Rules\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nMinimum of one interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs desired\n\nEffect\nPerform advanced engineering or technical tests towards equipment manufacture\n\nFocus\nDexterity (Crafting) or Intelligence (Engineering)\n\nEquipment manufacture is a necessity born of distance, scarcity, and independence in the Expanse. Far from Earth’s supply lines and Martian factories, Belters, outstation crews, and smugglers can’t rely on resupply or standard issue -- they must build what they need from what they have. Whether it’s forging replacement air filters from scavenged parts, printing custom weapon mods on a fabricators, or assembling drone components out of mining scraps, manufacturing gear in-house is often the only way to stay operational. It allows crews to tailor tools for unique missions, create backups of critical systems, and maintain autonomy from corporate or faction control. In the Belt, if you can’t build it, you’d better trade for it -- or go without.\n\nTo manufacture equipment a character must meet certain requirements:\n\nMaterials: The character needs the appropriate raw materials for the item. Unrestricted materials can be acquired by making an Income test against a Target Number (TN) equal to the item's value minus 5.\nTools and Equipment: Necessary tools and a workshop are crucial.\nAppropriate Focus: A character must possess a suitable &quot;manufacturing focus&quot;.\n\nDexterity (Crafting) -&gt; hand-crafted and artistic items\nIntelligence (Engineering) -&gt; technological items.\n\nCreating an item from scratch is resolved using an advanced test:\n\nTarget Number (TN): The TN for the test is the equivalent to the Equipment Adjustment [[#Success Threshold]]\nSuccess Threshold: The GM determines a success threshold based on the item's complexity:\n\n5 for a simple item.\n10 to 15 for more complex items.\n20 to 25 for truly complex works or pieces of equipment.\n\nFor each interlude shift a character dedicates to equipment manufacture, they can roll one advance test.\nExperimentation Rules\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nMinimum of one interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs desired\n\nEffect\nDouble advanced test towards developing new technology concepts\n\nFocus\n2 different Intelligence focuses\n\nExperimental tinkering is the engine of survival and progress in a system built on unreliable tech, recycled parts, and desperate innovation. Nowhere is this clearer than in the origin of the Epstein Drive itself -- a breakthrough born not in a government lab, but in a personal garage. Solomon Epstein’s overdrive of a fusion engine during personal experimentation led to the single greatest leap in human expansion, unlocking efficient long-burn travel and opening the Belt, the moons, and beyond. That spirit of hands-on experimentation still defines the frontier: Belter mechanics modulate scrubbers using salvaged Martian code, smugglers tweak sensor profiles to avoid detection, and pirates wire up disposable thrusters from mining equipment. In a setting where blueprints are outdated and factory parts are scarce, tinkering turns scrap into solutions, giving characters a chance to innovate, adapt, and sometimes create the next big thing -- just like Epstein did, burning too hard and too far, but changing the system forever.\n\nDedicating interlude time to experimenting provides an opportunity for characters to develop new technology concepts. To perform an experiment a character needs to nominate an objective and identify two Intelligence focuses that will underpin the experiment. In each interlude shift spent experimenting, the character will roll a challenge test against each of these focuses. If both tests pass, then both drama dice values get added to their progress. The TN and ST of the experiment will be determined by the GM taking into account the number of breakthroughs required to move for the current technology to the character's objective.\nKinaesthetic Discipline® Rules\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs desired\n\nEffect\nAccrue dexterity bonuses\n\nFocus\nDexterity\n\nMuscle mass and bone density are not the only things that degrade in zero/low-g environment. Reflexes and fine motor skills also atrophy. Recently the Ganymede Institute of Agronomics and Applied Sciences (GIAAS) developed Kinaesthetic Discipline®, a series of exercises and simulations that prevent and even reverse this atrophy. The naïve academics decided to post the research royalty-free into the feed before the corporations could get their hands on it. The lead author has subsequently disappeared.\n\nWhen a character dedicates an interlude shift to Kinaesthetic Discipline® they can accrue dexterity bonuses. These bonuses can be spent to boost a dexterity roll by +2. Once a bonus is spent it is gone.\nCharacters roll a straight dexterity skill test against TN 13. If they pass, the drama die is the number of dexterity bonuses they have accrued.\nA character may perform this activity once in an interlude.\nMental Conditioning Rules\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs desired\n\nEffect\nAccrue willpower bonuses\n\nFocus\nWillpower\n\nMental Conditioning originated as a psychological resilience program developed during the early Mars terraforming initiatives, when isolation, high-risk labour, and limited resources demanded exceptional emotional control and cognitive stability. Initially formalized by Martian neuropsychologists and military trainers, it combined mindfulness protocols, cognitive reinforcement, and sensory deprivation drills to enhance focus, discipline, and resistance to panic under stress. Over time, the practice spread to long-haul freighter crews, Belter survivalists, and security contractors across the system, evolving into a diverse set of routines -- part science, part ritual -- used to train the mind against fear, fatigue, and coercion in the harsh vacuum of the Belt and beyond.\n\nWhen a character dedicates an interlude shift to mental conditioning they can accrue willpower bonuses. These bonuses can be spent to boost a willpower roll by +2. Once a bonus is spent it is gone.\nCharacters roll a straight willpower skill test against TN 13. If they pass, the drama die is the number of willpower bonuses they have accrued.\nA character may perform this activity once in an interlude.\nRationing Rules\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs needed\n\nEffect\nMitigates the loss of supplies\n\nFocus\nIntelligence\n\nWhile most ships in the system are provisioned with enough supplies for standard operations, unexpected events -- like damage to recycling systems, extended missions, shiftades, or rerouted travel -- can radically shift anticipated needs. Spending Interlude time to implement rationing protocols reflects the crew’s proactive adaptation to scarcity, rather than reacting in crisis. It may involve recalibrating the water reclamation cycle, adjusting food distribution algorithms, or manually portioning breathable air in failing systems. This effort isn't just logistical -- it’s psychological, requiring coordination, trust, and mental resilience.\n\nCrew can mitigate the impacts of an unexpected drain on resources by dedicating interlude shifts to rationing.\nTo ration:\n\nThe GM will provide the TN reflective of the unexpected drain (eg. bad air scrubbers TN9, significant combat damage TN19)\nA character rolls a straight Intelligence test (+2 with a current audit)\n\nPass -&gt; supply loss has been mitigated\nFail -&gt; supply loss will have an impact sometime in the future (GM discretion)\n\nAdditional interlude shifts can be allocated to rationing, if the supply loss is not yet mitigated.\nRecovery Rules\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nMinimum of one interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs needed\n\nEffect\nBasic test to remove condition or gain fortune\n\nFocus\nConstitution (Stamina) or Intelligence (Medicine)\n\nThe universe of The Expanse is a dangerous place, and it is easy for characters to accrue physical conditions. To permanently remove these conditions as character must dedicate time to recovery in an appropriate facility (eg. medical clinic, or ship med bay). Even those who have survived an encounter unscratched, may need to recover from it. A character can also use a recovery interlude shift to recover fortune.\n\nRemove conditions\nTo remove conditions characters must make an advanced Constitution (Stamina) TN 11 test every interlude shift.\n\nIf the character is under medical care, a physician or an auto-doc (+2) can make an Intelligence (Medicine) test against the same TN, and you can use the better of the two rolls.\nTrack the result of the Drama Die for each successful test.\nOnce you reach a success threshold of 5, you can remove an injured condition.\n\nCondition\nRelevant Ability Test\nSuccess Threshold\nSpecial Notes\n\nInjured\nIntelligence (Medicine) or Constitution (Stamina)\n5\nMinor injury; quick rest or simple treatment often enough.\n\nWounded\nIntelligence (Medicine) or Constitution (Stamina)\n15\nRequires medical bay or extended care.\n\nFatigued\nConstitution (Stamina) or Willpower (Self-Discipline)\n4\nNo special equipment required\n\nExhausted\nConstitution (Stamina) or Willpower (Self-Discipline)\n10\nExtended rest or focused recovery needed.\n\nBlinded\nIntelligence (Medicine) or Constitution (Stamina)\n12\nOnly if temporary; permanent cases require prosthetic/augment.\n\nDeafened\nIntelligence (Medicine) or Constitution (Stamina)\n9\nOnly if temporary; permanent cases require prosthetic/augment.\n\nUnconscious\nIntelligence (Medicine) must be another character\n3\nStabilizes and awakens; failure: remain unconscious.\n\nDying\nIntelligence (Medicine) must be another character\n3\nOn success, character is stabilised and becomes Wounded, Unconscious and Exhausted\n\nRecovering fortune\nIf a character is recovering fortune, they can do so be dedicating a interlude shift to rest and recreation. They do not need any special facilities to do this. This recovery interlude can only be used to regain fortune and cannot be undertaken whilst the character is injured, wounded, fatigued, exhausted, unconscious or dying. Characters regain fortune at a rate of 10 + character level per interlude shift.\nRelating Rules\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nMinimum of one interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs needed\n\nEffect\nBuild bonds between characters\n\nFocus\nN/A\n\nIn the vast, isolating expanse of space, relationships are as critical to survival as oxygen and fuel. A crew that trusts one another can coordinate under fire, make tough calls without hesitation, and hold the line when systems fail or plans go sideways. In a setting where political tensions, corporate exploitation, and environmental fragility press in from all sides, strong personal bonds offer stability, loyalty, and emotional resilience. Building relations during Interludes isn’t just about friendship -- it’s a strategic choice that can defuse conflict, improve cooperation, and create lasting ties that influence future encounters, negotiations, or even loyalty in mutinous moments. A bonded crew acts as a single unit; a divided one tears itself apart in the cold dark.\n\nIf two characters spend an relating interlude shift with each other, they strengthen the bond intensity between them. The number of shifts required is the target bond intensity. For example, to move a bond from intensity 2 to 3, will require 3 shifts. No roll is required, but the type of relating can change the type of bond\nReputation Rules\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nPossibly one interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nOnce a week\n\nEffect\nBasic test to remove condition or gain fortune\n\nFocus\nCommunication (Expression, Performance or Deception)\n\nIn the fractured and often lawless landscape of the solar system, reputation is currency. With no central authority truly binding Earth, Mars, and the Belt, deals are made and broken on the strength of a name. A ship’s reputation can open locked docking bays, secure last-minute fuel, or scare off would-be pirates. For individuals, reputation shapes how factions, fixers, and station bosses treat you -- whether they offer you work, watch your back, or put a target on it. It precedes you in places you've never set foot, serving as both shield and sword in political dealings, street-level negotiations, and black-market exchanges. In The Expanse, where trust is rare and betrayal is common, reputation determines who survives the long haul -- and who gets spaced when no one’s watching.\n\nIf, within the last week, a character has relied upon their reputation, or acted in line with their reputation, in a way that word can spread, their reputation is maintained. Failing that a character can use a interlude shift to maintain their reputation spread. Similarly they can use a interlude shift to bolster or diminish their reputation spread. This often involves making their actions known or a denying their actions through media, such as interviews or broadcasting videos.\nTo maintain a reputation spread, characters need to dedicate one interlude shift and roll a TN11 Communication (Expression, Performance or Deception) ability test.\nTo bolster or diminish their reputation by one spread point they will need to dedicate one interlude shift and roll a TN13 Communication (Expression, Performance or Deception) ability test.\nTo create a reputation anew a character will need to highlight an appropriate behaviour in the previous week, and then dedicate one interlude shift and roll a TN15 Communication (Expression, Performance or Deception) ability test.\nResearching Rules\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude s\n\nFrequency\nAs d\n\nEffect\nRoll 4 advanced resear\n\nF Intelligence (Research) or other relevant focus ther ther\n\nResearching leads is how a smart crew stays ahead of the game in a system built on secrets, shifting alliances, and hidden agendas. Whether tracking down a missing freighter, verifying a shady cargo contract, or digging into a name whispered on backchannels, research turns rumours into actionable intel. In a world where stations lie, manifests are forged, and faction loyalties change with the burn cycle, blindly charging in is a shortcut to an airlock funeral. Digging into comm records, sifting through public data nets, bribing info brokers, or scraping old sensor logs during an Interlude gives the crew time to connect dots others miss. It turns scattered clues into solid direction, reveals hidden dangers, and sometimes exposes a deeper plot. In the Expanse, information isn’t just power -- it’s survival, profit, and leverage.\nDuring the campaign characters will come across many leads. Some of these leads will point to future missions, and some will turn out to be dead ends. Character can dedicate interlude shifts to researching these leads.\nAll leads research are normally research advance tests, but characters can use other focuses where appropriate. The GM will provide the TN and the ST for the test. Characters can roll four times during each interlude shift.\nShip Maintenance Rules\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nOnce per week per system\n\nEffect\nPrevent the accrual of loss conditions\n\nFocus\nN/A\n\nShip maintenance is the difference between life and death in the vacuum of space. Every ship, from a Martian corvette to a Belter junk-hauler, is a self-contained ecosystem -- housing life support, propulsion, power, and environmental controls in a fragile, complex balance. Microfractures in a bulkhead, fouled scrubbers, a lagging thrust vector -- all of these can cascade into catastrophic failure if left unchecked. In the Belt especially, where replacement parts are scarce and station mechanics might not be trustworthy, routine maintenance becomes a sacred ritual. A well-maintained ship is faster, safer, and more efficient; it burns less fuel, resists radiation better, and holds together under stress. Crews who respect their vessel treat it like a living thing -- monitoring her sounds, smells, and quirks -- because in the black, your ship isn’t just your ride; it’s your only shelter, your last line of defence, and often, your only home.\n\nA spaceship has four distinct systems that need to be maintained:\n\nHull and structure\nManoeuvrability systems -- includes thrusters and the Epstein drive\nSensor systems -- including computer systems\nWeapon systems -- torpedoes, railguns, PDCs and grapplers\n\nFailure to maintain systems\nIf a ships systems have not been maintain in the past week, then the player has to roll on each system that has not been maintained. If they roll a 1 2 or 3, that system will accrue a loss condition (see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/diomedes-spear/rules/space-combat/\">Space Combat</a>). This condition will be removed by it's next maintenance. The number of dice rolled is equal to the number of weeks it has been without maintenance (ie. after two weeks without maintenance, roll two dice).\nSituational Awareness Simulations\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs desired\n\nEffect\nAccrue perception bonuses\n\nFocus\nPerception\n\nSituational Awareness Simulations were first developed by the Martian Congressional Republic Navy during the early terraforming era, when operating in low-visibility, high-risk environments demanded rapid threat recognition and spatial comprehension under extreme stress. These training protocols combined zero-g tactical exercises, sensor blinding drills, and multispectral threat identification into immersive VR suites aboard naval stations and fleet carriers. As piracy, boarding actions, and deep-space salvage operations became more common throughout the system, civilian security firms, Belter prospectors, and outer-system smugglers adapted the simulations into modular programs -- ranging from improvised drills in vac-sealed corridors to open-source VR patches -- making situational awareness a prized survival skill in the void.\n\nWhen a character dedicates an interlude shift to mental conditioning they can accrue perception bonuses. These bonuses can be spent to boost a perception roll by +2. Once a bonus is spent it is gone.\nCharacters roll a straight perception skill test against TN 13. If they pass, the drama die is the number of perception bonuses they have accrued.\nA character may perform this activity once in an interlude.\nSleep rules\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nOnce per day\n\nEffect\nPrevent loss of fortune and function\n\nFocus\nConstitution (Stamina)\n\nSleep is essential for survival in the harsh conditions of space -- not just for physical health, but for mental stability, decision-making, and crew cohesion. In microgravity environments and high-stress operations, the human body suffers disrupted circadian rhythms, reduced immune response, and deteriorating cognitive function. A tired crew makes mistakes: missed readings, delayed reactions, emotional outbursts. In combat, a split-second lapse can mean decompression or death. Regular, quality sleep helps regulate hormones, restore stamina, and maintain emotional balance -- vital when confined with others in tight, recycled-air quarters for months at a time. In The Expanse, where long burns, erratic schedules, and mission pressure are the norm, sleep isn’t a luxury -- it’s a strategic necessity. Crews that skip it too often burn out, break down, or turn on each other, becoming their own worst threat in the black.\n\nEvery character should allocate one interlude shift per day to sleep. This doesn't just represent sleep, it includes hygiene care and other 'personal' pursuits. If a character does not sleep, they following effect will occur\n\nDay\nEffect\n\n1st\n-5 fortune &amp; Constitution (Stamina) TN 15 to avoid condition\n\n2nd\n-10 fortune &amp; Constitution (Stamina) TN 15 to avoid condition\n\n3rd\n-15 fortune &amp; Constitution (Stamina) TN 15 to avoid condition\n\n4th\n-20 fortune + Unconscious condition\n\nCondition progression Normal -&gt; Fatigued -&gt; Exhausted -&gt; Unconscious\n\nStudy Rules\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs desired\n\nEffect\nAccrue communication or intelligence bonuses\n\nFocus\nCommunication or Intelligence\n\nIn the resource-strained environments of the Belt and outer planets, formal education is rare, but study -- especially self-directed or apprentice-based learning -- remains a vital path to advancement. On stations and ships, knowledge is often passed through trade manuals, archived data partitions, or oral histories recorded in tightbeam journals. Studying these materials -- whether ancient Earth rhetorical texts, Martian engineering treatises, or pirate-patched training sims -- allows individuals to hone reasoning, refine speech, or gain technical mastery. Those who dedicate Interlude time to focused study can sharpen their Intelligence through structured logic and theory, or improve Communication by internalizing persuasive tactics, intercultural nuance, and leadership protocols -- skills critical for surviving negotiation, command, or deception in a fractured solar system.\n\nWhen a character dedicates an interlude shift to study they can accrue either communication or intelligence bonuses. They need to nominate which attribute they are focusing on at the beginning of the interlude shift. These bonuses can be spent to boost a communication or intelligence roll by +2. Once a bonus is spent it is gone.\nCharacters roll a straight communication or intelligence skill test against TN 13. If they pass, the drama die is the number of communication or intelligence bonuses they have accrued.\nA character may perform this activity twice in an interlude.\nTraining Rules\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nOnce after level progression\n\nEffect\nEnables access to new focuses, talents, degrees, or specialisations\n\nFocus\nN/A\n\nTraining transforms a one-off event into a habit by embedding action into memory, reducing hesitation, and building automaticity. A single successful act -- like disarming a bomb, docking under pressure, or bluffing a hostile customs agent -- proves something is possible, but it doesn’t make it reliable. Through repetition, the brain forms stronger neural pathways, turning deliberate decisions into instinctive responses. In the hostile environments of The Expanse, where reaction time and consistency can mean the difference between docking and drifting, training ensures that what once required focus becomes second nature. It removes the uncertainty from high-risk actions and prepares the body and mind to act automatically, even under stress, fatigue, or fear. In other words, training turns experience into readiness -- and readiness into survival.\n\nWhen a character acquires new focuses, talents, degrees, or specialisations through a level progression, during the next interlude they need to dedicate one shift to training these new skills.\nUnarmed Combat Training Rules\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs desired\n\nEffect\nAccrue fighting bonuses\n\nFocus\nFighting\n\nUnarmed Combat Training has deep roots across the system, from Martian Marine close-quarters protocols to Belt-born brawling techniques developed in tight corridors and zero-g. In confined environments where firearms can breach hull integrity or weapons are confiscated during inspections, the ability to neutralize threats with bare hands or improvised holds becomes essential. Martian instructors formalized it into gravity-variable martial arts programs, while Belter factions adapted it into fluid, fast-paced systems optimized for low-g grappling and rapid disarms. Crew members, smugglers, and security personnel train during Interludes to build muscle memory, improve coordination, and maintain combat readiness -- gaining mechanical benefits to close combat and increasing survivability in any scrap where bullets aren't an option.\n\nWhen a character dedicates an interlude shift to mental conditioning they can accrue fighting bonuses. These bonuses can be spent to boost a fighting roll by +2. Once a bonus is spent it is gone.\nCharacters roll a straight fighting skill test against TN 13. If they pass, the drama die is the number of fighting bonuses they have accrued.\nA character may perform this activity once in an interlude.\nWatch rules\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nThree times a day\n\nEffect\nObserve events on and around the ship\n\nFocus\nPerception (Hearing or Seeing)\n\nKeeping watch is a quiet but vital act of vigilance -- a shield against the complacency that kills in space, and a window into the unexpected. Even when the weapons rest and the crew goes about their interludes, danger doesn’t. Pirates, corporate enforcers, rogue AIs, or slow-leaking coolant lines don’t wait for anyone to be ready. A proper watch rotation ensures someone is always scanning the sensors, checking hull integrity, monitoring life support, or listening for whispers in the comms. But it’s not just about catching threats -- watch is often when the strange things surface: faint transponder echoes, anomalous debris patterns, old signals in forgotten bands. It maintains discipline, enforces routine, and gives the rest of the crew space to recover safely. Neglect it, and one quiet hour can turn into catastrophe. Keep it, and the ship stays a step ahead of the void -- and maybe catches a secret no one was meant to see.\n\nTo dedicate an interlude shift to the watch, a character must only engage in light activities that will not distract them from monitoring the sensors. Additionally, the character cannot be Fatigued or Exhausted. To determine the effectiveness of the watch, the character makes a basic Perception (Hearing or Seeing) test against the difficulty of observing an event.\nSince the character on watch is mostly relaxing, they also recover fortune at half the rate according to the [[#Recovery Rules]].\nWorkout rules\n\nFeature\nDetails\n\nHow long\nOne interlude shift\n\nFrequency\nAs desired\n\nEffect\nAccrue constitution or strength bonuses\n\nFocus\nConstitution or Strength\n\nWorkouts -- structured physical training routines -- are essential for maintaining Stamina and Strength in the low-gravity environments of the Belt, stations, and ships, where muscle atrophy and bone loss are constant threats. From Martian military regimens conducted under artificial gravity to resistance-band drills used by Belters in narrow corridors, these routines are more than discipline -- they’re survival. Regular training improves Strength by reinforcing muscle mass and boosting explosive power, vital for handling gear, fighting in confined spaces, or brute-forcing machinery. Simultaneously, workouts enhance Stamina by expanding cardiovascular capacity and improving endurance in high-stress, oxygen-thin conditions.\n\nWhen a character dedicates an interlude shift to workout they can accrue either constitution or strength bonuses. They need to nominate which attribute they are focusing on at the beginning of the interlude shift. These bonuses can be spent to boost a constitution or strength roll by +2. Once a bonus is spent it is gone.\nCharacters roll a straight constitution or strength skill test against TN 13. If they pass, the drama die is the number of constitution or strength bonuses they have accrued.\nA character may perform this activity twice in an interlude.",

		"content": "Membership in The Expanse Roleplaying Game represents a character's formal connection to, and influence within, a large organisation. Unlike honorifics, which are titles reflecting a character's reputation that others react to, membership grants specific access and authority due to one's standing in a group.\nWhat it Represents\n\nMembership signifies a character's influence within an organisation.\nIt measures their connection to large groups of people.\nOrganisations can be diverse, ranging from governments (e.g., Martian Navy), corporations (e.g., Star Helix Security), media outlets, religious groups (e.g., The Mormons), to criminal syndicates (e.g., Golden Bough Society, Loca Greiga).\n\nHow Membership is Gained and Advanced\n\nCharacter Creation: Characters can start with membership based on their backgrounds or professions. It can also be a benefit from a character's chosen drive (specifically, a Rank 1 Membership increase).\nIn-Play Progression: Characters advance through the ranks of an organisation by being awarded a rank increase by the Game Master (GM).\nInterlude Activity: Once awarded, characters must spend an interlude performing the &quot;Advancement&quot; activity to solidify their new rank. This may require an advanced ability test, such as Communication, if the GM feels it necessary to &quot;close the deal&quot; and demonstrate the character's worthiness. The success threshold for this test is typically low (5-10).\nTalents: The Executive talent explicitly grants the character a Membership in a new organisation or advances their rank in an existing one.\n\nLevels/Ranks of Membership\nMembership is structured into three distinct ranks, each offering increasing benefits and responsibilities:\nRank 1: Recruit\n\nBonus: New recruits receive a +1 bonus to all rolls related to positive dealings within the organisation's ranks. This bonus can increase to +2 if the character already had good relations with the group.\nAccess: They gain access to the group's basic resources, such as provided services, shared credit accounts, company housing, or discounted professional services. Military and security organisations may provide access to equipment and weapons not available to civilians.\nStatus: Recruits are often tested and evaluated before being given greater trust or access. They typically know only their immediate superiors and fellow recruits. They are expected to prove themselves.\n\nRank 2: Respected Member\n\nBonus: After proving themselves, respected members gain a +2 bonus to any tests involving other members of their organisation at their rank or lower. They also receive a +1 bonus in social interactions with non-members who have reason to respect or fear their organisation.\nAccess: They gain access to their group's full organisational resources, which usually includes other personnel. They can command subordinates to perform easy encounters or use organisational resources to pay recruits to handle tasks of average difficulty. This extends to wealth, equipment, information, and access to high-ranking individuals with connections.\nExpectations: At this rank, members are expected to act in the group's best interests and not to waste resources on personal goals.\n\nRank 3: Authority Figure\n\nInfluence: This is the pinnacle of power within an organisation, often achieved only by those who founded the group.\nControl: Authority figures have full control over the group's priorities and actions. This control does not extend to what members think about the group, only what they must do to remain loyal.\nSocial Bonus: They gain an additional +1 bonus (for a total of +2) in social situations where their control of the group would impress non-members.\n\nImpact on Gameplay\n\nAccess to Jobs and Services: Membership can be a prerequisite for accessing military shipyards or for securing contracts with government or corporate clients.\nResource Management: An organisation's Economy rating can reduce the difficulty of Income tests for purchasing goods, with the character's Membership rank capping the maximum reduction. Membership can also be used towards payment for services, establishing credit, or securing discounts on repairs and maintenance for ships.\nSocial Dynamics: Membership influences how NPCs react to characters and can provide bonuses in social tests. Certain social stunts, like &quot;In Good Standing&quot; or &quot;Oozing Confidence,&quot; can leverage Membership benefits. The Journalist stunt &quot;Fourth Estate&quot; even allows for temporarily gaining a Membership rank when covering an organisation.\nNarrative: Disparate ranks among player characters or conflicts between organisations can create compelling roleplaying opportunities. The GM may also give Membership to important NPCs so they can participate in stunts that use these traits.",

They may nurse a grudge and oppose the characters in the future. This is a rare spontaneous impression, and the GM should come up with a specific reason why any first impression would get a Very Hostile response.\n\n4-5\nHostile\n-2\nThe hostile NPC reacts to contact with ire, but might disguise this. They either refuse to provide help, or undermine the characters’ apparent interests.\n\n6-8\nStandoffish\n-1\nThe standoffish NPC would prefer that the characters just leave them alone. They either avoid the characters, ignore them, or firmly ask interlopers to go away.\n\n9-11\nNeutral\n+0\nThe neutral NPC hasn’t decided things either way about characters making contact, and responds with cool caution, bored disinterest, or polite detachment, depending on their personality.\n\n12-14\nOpen\n+1\nThe open NPC is curious or inclined to listen to the characters, and reacts appropriately based on their own motives and interests. Things could go either way. A negative variation of Open is Cowed, where the NPC is a bit afraid of what the characters might do if they don’t act receptive. Once the threat appears to be gone, the NPC becomes Standoffish.\n\n15-17\nFriendly\n+2\nThe friendly NPC takes a shine to characters making contact and is inclined to help them, but hesitates to provide any assistance that could cause them problems. A negative variation of Friendly is Shaken, where the NPC provides assistance out of fear. Once the threat appears to be gone, the NPC becomes Hostile.\n\n18+\nVery Friendly\n+3\nThe very friendly NPC is exceptionally welcoming, and provides gestures of respect or hospitality without being prompted. The NPC may provide extraordinary help, though nothing that contradicts their values. This is a rare spontaneous impression, and the GM should come up with a specific reason why any first impression would get a Very Friendly response. A negative variation of Very Friendly is Terrified, where the NPC anxiously does anything possible to avoid a perceived (or very real) threat. Once the threat is gone and the NPC feels safe, their attitude shifts to Very Hostile.\n\nInteractions\nSimple Social Interactions\nCommunication test vs NPC Willpower\nDetailed Social Interactions\nGoal is to change an NPC’s attitude to one where they feel inclined to do something in your favour.\nSocial Combat\nDetermine shifts required:\n\nDecide NPC’s current attitude, and the attitude required to comply with your wishes.\nNote number of shifts to move along character\nAdd 1 shift to focus the NPC’s attention toward doing what you wish\nCan add 1 or 2 shifts to represent the NPC’s greater resistance to your efforts if the desired actions would inconvenience or trouble them in some way\n\nShifts can be achieved through:\n\nSocial manoeuvres:\n\nEach shift becomes an action\nCan be opposed tests or tasks to complete\nClear additional shifts first\nUtterly failing -&gt; may set back progress by one or more shifts\n\nGrand gesture:\n\nperform a single ambitious gesture intended to influence the NPC in one fell swoop\nadvanced test -&gt; 3-5 x number of shifts\nachieving threshold -&gt; success, falling short -&gt; nothing",

A commander can continue making this test until they have enough SP for the desired stunt.Planning cannot be used simply to increase the effectiveness of a specific stunt, such as Guidance or Evasive Action, but can only be spent building toward a stunt with a specific cost.\n\nCommand Stunts\n\nSP\nStunt\nDetails\n\n1+\nGuidance\n+1 bonus to chosen ship combat test this round.Choose from:- manoeuvre test- electronic warfare test- evasion test- point defence test- damage control test\n\n1+\nBlinding Manoeuvre\nReduces an opposing ship’s Sensors score by 1 (to a minimum score of –2) until the start of the next round.\n\n2\nMulti-targeting\nPBCs can both attack and defend this round without any penalty.\n\n2\nDown With the Ship\nIn an act of heroism, the commander can expend their own Fortune to remove damage taken by other characters (as the result of a Collateral Loss) on board the ship.\n\n2+\nOn-target\nIncreases the TN of tests to evade your ship’s weapon attacks that round by +1.\n\n2+\nTactics\nIncreases the TN of an opposing ship commander’s next command test by +1.\n\n3\nPerceived weakness\nYou increase the damage of one successful weapon attack by 1d6.\n\n3+\nEvasive Action\nGrants a +1d6 Hull bonus to your ship that round for resisting damage from successful weapon attacks.\n\n3+\nCalculation\nYou can bank the SP you just spent for this stunt +1 and use them on a later stunt. You can also combine these SP with future SP earned.\n\n4\nPrecise hit\nOne successful weapon attacks results in an additional Loss, even if the target’s Hull completely eliminated the damage\n\n4\nSkimming\nIf a space battle takes place near a planet with an atmosphere, you can dive into the planet’s atmosphere to avoid being targeted and perhaps even lose your pursuer completely.Your pilot must make an opposed TN 17 Dexterity (Piloting) test to succeed.- Success -&gt; the pursuing ship loses track of your ship in the atmosphere, at least temporarily.On following rounds, the pursuing ship can make opposed TN 11 Intelligence (Technology) + Sensors tests to reacquire a target on your ship.\n\n4\nToo Close\nTo perform this stunt, you must be engaged against multiple enemy ships and at close range to one that is of at least one size class larger. A space station can also count as a larger ship.The pilot manoeuvres into a position that makes it difficult for enemies to target your ship without risking damage to the other ship.During the Manoeuvre phase, the pilot must make a successful opposed TN 15 Dexterity (Piloting) test against the larger ship at -2. The difficulty is reduced by 1 for every additional size class greater the enemy ship is than the crew’s ship.- Success -&gt; the pilot gains a +2 to their evasion test against any ships other than the ship they are using for cover- Any attacks that miss the crew’s ship hit the larger ship if the pilot rolls a 5 or 6 on the Drama Die.- If both ships fail the piloting test -&gt; the ships collide, causing 2d6 damage to the larger ship and 4d6 damage to the smaller ship.\n\n4+\nSet-up\nYou manoeuvre an opposing ship into a hazard, such as a normally shorter-range weapon, a field of debris, or even a floating rock.This stunt is considered a weapon attack inflicting damage dice equal to half the SP spent (round down).Can be evaded with the TN = 10 + your Intelligence + Leadership focus (if any) + half the SP spent\n\n5\nBurn Them\nAn Epstein drive emits a powerful drive plume that can, in a pinch, be used as a weapon. To do this successfully, the ship must be at close range and perform a sudden flip and burn that points the drive plume directly at the enemy ship.The ships must be at extremely close range, so this manoeuvre can’t be used in normal engagements - only if circumstances have dictated that the ships are very close (under 1 km). Unfortunately, this manoeuvre leaves the crew’s ship vulnerable and open to attack.To successfully perform this manoeuvre, the pilot must also make a successful opposed TN 19 Dexterity (Piloting) test against the other ship at -2. If successful, the other ship is engulfed in your drive plume, causing 6d6 damage. The downside is that only rear-facing weapons can fire while the ship performs this manoeuvre, and enemy ships have a +2 to their evasion tests. Also, due to being in an exposed position, all evasion tests are at -2. If the pilot fails this test, they fail to engulf the enemy ship with the drive plume but still suffer all of the associated penalties.\n\n5\nWeapon Online\nOne of the crew can temporarily bring a damaged weapon, or a weapon that has run out of ammo, back online.A character can attempt a TN 14 Intelligence (Engineering) or Dexterity (Gunnery) test to bring a weapon back online.The weapon can make 1d3 shots before giving up the ghost for good, requiring a proper repair. The weapon cannot be brought back online again without the ship receiving full maintenance at a spaceport.\n\n6\nQuick Start\nThe crew can attempt to make a quick repair and restart the ship’s reactor.This requires two characters to work together; one must make a TN 14 Intelligence (Technology) test and another must make a TN 14 Intelligence (Engineering) test, and they must reach a threshold of 15.\n\n7\nMisdirect\nWhen attempting to outrun a torpedo, you can fly close to another ship to try to get the torpedo to hit that ship instead of your own. You perform a flip and burn when near another ship.The pilot must make a successful opposed Dexterity (Piloting) test against the other ship and another member of the crew must make a TN 17 Technology (Intelligence) test. If both are successful, the torpedo impacts the other ship instead.\n\nPilot Actions\nStep 2: Manoeuvres\n\nOption\nDetails\n\nChange Range\nAutomatically change by one range band\n\nPrevent change\n- Opposed Dexterity (Piloting) test between the two ships to prevent change in range- Smaller ship getting a +1 bonus per Size category smaller than the larger ship\n\nHigh-G Manoeuvring\n- Adds a bonus from +1 to +6 to the manoeuvre test result- Allows the ship to shift up to two range bands.\n\nHigh-G effects\nRequires all characters on board to perform a Constitution (Stamina) test with a TN of 8 + manoeuvre bonus:- failure -&gt; the character suffers 1d6 penetrating damage per point of manoeuvre bonus- success -&gt; half 1d6 penetrating damage per point of manoeuvre bonus\n\nThe Juice\nCharacters with access to the juice can take fatigued and exhausted conditions first to mitigate the damage before they take injured or wounded conditions, otherwise they have to take just injured and wounded conditions.\n\nStep 5: Defensive Actions\n\nOption\nDetails\n\nEvade Torpedo\nComplete a Evade test for each torpedo- Launched from Long Range -&gt; cannot evade, only shoot down- Launched from Medium Range -&gt; 3d6 + Dex (Piloting) vs. TN 12 + attacking ship sensors + attack bonus- Launched from Short Range -&gt; 3d6 + Dex (Piloting) vs. TN 10 + attacking ship sensors + attack bonus\n\nEvade Railgun\n- Long Range -&gt; automatic success- Medium Range -&gt;&gt; 3d6 + Dex (Piloting) vs. TN 10 + attacking ship sensors + attack bonus- Short Rang-&gt; -&gt; 3d6 + Dex (Piloting) vs. TN 12 + attacking ship sensors + attack bonus\n\nEvade PDC\n- Long Range -&gt; automatic success- Medium Range -&gt; automatic success- Short Range -&gt; 3d6 + Dex (Piloting) vs. TN 10 + attacking ship sensors + attack bonus - If opponent used PDC for defence and attack -&gt; TN 8\n\nHigh-G Manoeuvring\n- Adds a bonus from +1 to +6 to the evasion test result\n\nHigh-G effects\nRequires all characters on board to perform a Constitution (Stamina) test with a TN of 8 + manoeuvre bonus:- failure -&gt; the character suffers 1d6 penetrating damage per point of manoeuvre bonus- success → half 1d6 penetrating damage per point of manoeuvre bonus\n\nThe Juice\nCharacters with access to the juice can take fatigued and exhausted conditions first to mitigate the damage before they take injured or wounded conditions, otherwise they have to take just injured and wounded conditions.\n\nPiloting Stunts\n\nSP\nStunt\nDetails\n\n1+\nBlinding Manoeuvre\nReduces an opposing ship’s Sensors score by 1 (to a minimum score of –2) until the start of the next round.\n\n2+\nSteady as She Goes\nPilot can lessen the potential high-g manoeuvres damage to passengers. For every 2 SP spent the TN for the Constitution (Stamina) test is reduced by 1.\n\n3+\nEvasive Action\nGrants a +1d6 Hull bonus to your ship that round for resisting damage from successful weapon attacks.\n\n4\nBlockade\nThe pilot manoeuvres the ship to make it difficult for an enemy ship to fire on or pursue its chosen target (unless that target is the pilot’s ship).The enemy ship suffers a -2 penalty to any manoeuvre test to pursue or attack its original target. Or the targeted ship gets a +2 to its evasion test.\n\n4+\nSet-up\nYou manoeuvre an opposing ship into a hazard, such as a normally shorter-range weapon, a field of debris, or even a floating rock.This stunt is considered a weapon attack inflicting damage dice equal to half the SP spent (round down).Can be evaded with the TN = 10 + your Intelligence + Leadership focus (if any) + half the SP spent\n\n5\nDauntless\nThe pilot aims their ship at an enemy ship as if to ram it, to cause it to veer off course and miss their attack opportunity. This manoeuvre can only be used when the ships are already at close range.The enemy ship must make a successful TN 15 Dexterity (Piloting) test or not be able to take any other action as they recover from the threat of being rammed. If the enemy ship doesn’t flinch, the pilot must make a successful TN 17 Dexterity (Piloting) test to avoid hitting the ship they were aiming at although their ship still gets to take other actions.\n\nComms Officer Actions\nStep 3: Electronic Warfare\n\nOption\nDetails\n\nEW Test\nOpposed Intelligence (Technology) test + Ship sensors vs TN 11Winner gains half drama die (rounded up) bonus to apply to:- Defensive actions- TN of your attack that round\n\nElectronic Warfare Stunts\n\nSP\nStunt\nDetails\n\n2+\nTurnabout is Fair Play\nIf a torpedo is being manually controlled, the sensors operator can attempt to wrest control of the torpedo from the other ship. If there is more than one torpedo, 2 SP can be spent to attempt to control each.Opposed Intelligence (Technology) + Sensors test against the enemy ship.\n\n3\nPerceived weakness\nYou increase the damage of one successful weapon attack by 1d6.\n\n4\nHack the System\nWhile scanning the enemy ship for weaknesses, the sensors operator detects an opening in the enemy ship’s computer system. They can attempt to hack the enemy’s ship to temporarily disable one or more systems. To do this, a PC must make an opposed Intelligence (Technology) + Sensors test against the enemy ship. If successful, they can shut down one system on that ship (weapons, sensors, engines, etc.). They remain offline until someone on the enemy ship makes a successful TN 15 Intelligence (Technology) test.\n\nWeapons Officer Actions\nStep 3: Weapon Attacks\n\nOption\nDetails\n\nAttack\nEach of the ship’s weapons within range can attack an available target designated by a crew member with weapons control.\n\nEffective Weapon Ranges\n- Grapplers -&gt; up to Close- PDCs -&gt; up to Close- Rail Gun -&gt; up to Medium- Torpedo -&gt; up to Long\n\nTorpedo time to impact\n- Close range -&gt; same round as launch- Medium range -&gt; next round after launch- Long range -&gt; two rounds after launch\n\nTargeted Attacks\nCharacters can choose to fire a targeted weapon attack aimed at causing a particular type of loss to the target:- Targets: - Collateral -&gt; TN 11 -&gt; Hull modifier ¾ - Manoeuvrability -&gt; TN 13 -&gt; Hull modifier ⅓ - Sensors -&gt; TN 15 -&gt; Hull modifier ½ - Weapons -&gt; TN 15 -&gt; Hull modifier ½- the attack cannot cause any effect greater than the intended loss- cannot take out the target ship- any damage in excess of the intended loss has no effect\n\nGunnery skill\nCharacters can replace the ship’s sensor score with their Dexterity (Gunnery) score.\n\nStep 5: Defensive Actions\n\nOption\nDetails\n\nPoint Defence\nCan only be used on torpedoes.Can roll a point defence test for each torpedo in close range\n\nPoint Defence Test\n3d6 + Sensors vs TN 10 + Attacking Ship's Sensors + attack bonusesIf PBC have been used for attack in this round TN 12\n\nGunnery skill\nCharacters can replace the ship’s sensor score with their Dexterity (Gunnery) score.\n\nWeapons Officer Stunts\n\nSP\nStunt\nDetails\n\n2\nMulti-targeting\nPBCs can both attack and defend this round without any penalty.\n\n2+\nOn-target\nIncreases the TN of tests of your opponent to evade your ship’s weapon attacks that round by +1.\n\n4\nPrecise hit\nOne successful weapon attack results in an additional Loss, even if the target’s Hull completely eliminated the damage\n\nEngineer Actions\nStep 6: Weapon Attacks\n\nOption\nDetails\n\nAttack damage roll\n- Grapplers -&gt; n/a- PDCs -&gt; 2d6- Rail Gun -&gt; 3d6- Torpedo -&gt; 4d6\n\nApplying damage\n1.

If the crew does not meet the min, add a -2 modifier for each category drop.\nCrew Competence\nFor ships crew by NPCs, ability test bonuses are determined by the crew competence.\n\nCompetence\nBonus\n\nIncompetent\n0\n\nPoor\n1\n\nAverage\n2\n\nCapable\n3\n\nSkilled\n4\n\nElite\n5\n\nDrive\nEven at a high-g burn, regular breaks must be taken for the crew to attend to their biological needs and recover, which means that ships must have stores of food, water, air, medicine, and other consumables in proportion to the crew and the distance the ship plans to travel.\nAn Epstein Drive plume is visible and detectable over a considerable distance, meaning a ship on the burn is fairly easy to track.\nThe plume itself is capable of reducing any matter in it down to its constituent atoms, and firing a drive in close proximity to a station, an asteroid, or another ship can cause considerable damage.\nSensors\nA ship’s Sensors score measures the overall effectiveness of this equipment, on a range from –2 to 6 or more.\nWeapons\nWhile civilian ships are unarmed, military and security craft have a variety of weapons, as do some pirates and similar illegal ships.\nTypes of weapons:\n\nGrapplers\nPoint defence cannons (PBCs)\nRail Guns\nTorpedoes\n\nCountermeasures\nMost ships also have defensive countermeasures packages used to help keep enemies from targeting them:\n\nCommunications arrays can broadcast cycling bursts of radio static across commonly used frequencies to jam communications, and at close enough range\nCommunications lasers can be used to try and blind enemy targeting optics\nPhysical chaff can be ejected into space between the ship and enemies, spreading out clutter to interfere with targeting lasers or radar.\n\nQualities and flaws\nQualities\n\nQuality\nEffect\n\nAcceleration, Improved\nThe ship can accelerate faster. When performing a high-g maneuver, the ship can add a bonus of up to +7. The ship also gets a +1 to the Piloting test when attempting to increase or decrease range. Additional applications of this bonus can be taken, which increases the high-g maneuver bonus by 1 for each, up to a maximum of +9. Each additional level also grants another +1 to the Piloting test to increase range, up to a maximum of +3.\n\nAdvanced Sensor Package\n+1 increase in Sensors score for each time this quality is applied.Sensors score usually maxes out at 6, unless the GM chooses to make an exception.\n\nAgile\nOnly ships of Small or Medium size can take this quality. The ship is extremely nimble and able to maneuver easier than other ships. The ship gets a +1 to Evasion tests and any other Piloting tests that require maneuverability. Additional applications can be taking which grant an additional +1 up to a maximum of +3. A ship must be designed and built to have this capability. It cannot be added later.\n\nAltered Transponder Code\nThe ship has access to or use of an altered transponder code, allowing it to appear as another ship with a different name and point of origin. This can provide a way around any number of prob lems that might arise in the course of a vessel’s life. It should be noted that changing a transponder code is highly illegal. MCRN ships are designed as such so that if the transponder code is altered without the proper access codes the ship self-destructs.\n\nAtmosphere Capable\nThe ship can operate in a planetary atmosphere for limited periods of time and is capable of landing. Generally, a ship must be designed and built to have this capability. It cannot be added later.\n\nCommunication Systems, Advanced\nThe ship’s communications systems, both tightbeam and radio array, have an increased bandwidth that results in shorter relay times, although lightspeed still dictates the minimum transmis sion time of interplanetary communications. The advanced communications system can also send and receive encrypted messages and provide a private network for all inbound and outbound comm traffic. It can even break through some jamming frequencies. Flagships often have advanced communications systems so that they can better organize attacks. The SP cost for any Fleet Command Stunts is reduced by 1.\n\nDisguise\nThe ship has been disguised in some way to conceal its true provenance or purpose. While not as effec tive as stealth, Disguise combined with an Altered Transponder Code, may allow a ship to pass inspection if those looking don’t know what they’re looking for. This can counter the Wanted flaw (see the Spaceships chapter of The Expanse RPG) or similar difficulties but is not meant as a permanent solution to either.\n\nDrone Bay\nThe ship has at least two drones for combat, visual reconnaissance, or repair. These can be remote controlled by crewmembers who can pilot them or by a computer system.\n\nEmergency Batteries\nAll ships have batteries that allow them to run life support and maneuvering thrusters (although not the Epstein drive) even when the engines are offline for a limited period—usually less than a week depending how much power is used. Emergency batteries allow a ship to operate for months without reactor power.\n\nFlagship\nFlagships are the leaders to fleets and are often on the front line and the hub of command and communi cations in battle. During the Command step of space combat, the flagship generates an additional 2 SP and can give any of their generated SP to allied ships. This SP is added to any SP generated by that ship during its Command step.\n\nGood Juice\n+2 bonus on Constitution (Stamina) tests against high-acceleration manoeuvres.\n\nGourmet Galley\nThe ship has an extensive galley capable of turning out extravagant meals that are well-balanced and nutritious, and nutritious. It also has a high-quality coffee (and beverage) maker that makes a cup of coffee as good as any found on Earth. The crew has a +1 bonus to a Constitution or Willpower test once per session when they have regular access. Maintaining this quality requires adding +1 to the Resupply Cost to maintain the ship (see Resupply in Chapter 1 of this book). The crew can eliminate this cost by losing this quality.\n\nHanger Bay\nCarrying ships totalling up to three or more Size categories smaller than it. Contains all of the necessary equipment for maintenance.\n\nHidden Compartments\nDesigned for smuggling or otherwise concealing cargo from inspections or borders.\n\nHull Platting\n+1 bonus when determining its Hull total against damage. Have multiple times, up to a maximum equal to its Hull score in dice.\n\nImproved Stores\nCapable of stocking supplies for extended travel for its crew and a number of passengers equal to half its optimal crew listing.\n\nLuxury Amenities\nEspecially fine or luxurious accommodations.Adds +1 to the Lifestyle Cost to maintain the shipContributes to reputations\n\nManoeuvrable\nConsidered one Size category smaller than its actual Size for tests to change range, to evade attacks, and for chases. Highly Manoeuvrable -&gt; effectively two Size categories smaller.\n\nMedical Expert System\nauto doc provides treatment character with the Intelligence (Medicine) focus with a +2 bonus. Additional applications -&gt; +1 bonus per option to a maximum of +5.\n\nNetwork and Database Access, Improved\nIn addition to the public access databases and local networks, the ship has improved and private access to more advanced stores and databanks of information. Using this terminal can give a +1 bonus to any advanced Intelligence (Current Affairs or Research) test made on board.\n\nPlasma Torpedoes\nThe ship must have a Torpedo Launcher. The ship is equipped with plasma torpedoes, designed to burn through hulls and inflict focused damage. The torpedo does 4d6 damage, and when a 1 or 2 is rolled for damage, it is counted as a 3.\n\nRail Gun, High-Charge\nThe ship must be at least Large Size. These rail guns fire with a higher thrust than stan dard issue rail guns, and the slugs are supercharged to do extra damage when they impact with hulls. The rail gun does 3d6 damage, but when a 1 or 2 is rolled for damage, it is counted as a 3.\n\nRapid Reload Torpedo Tubes\nThe ship can reload torpedoes at a faster than normal rate. SP cost to use the Rapid Reload Command Stunt is reduced by 1.\n\nReduced Crew Requirements\nThe ship has optimized controls to allow it to be manned by a smaller crew. Halve the crew requirement for the ship (with a minimum of 1)\n\nReliable\nThe ship is particularly dependable: it works the way it’s supposed to when its crew needs it to, and its upkeep is minimal. Though the crew still must dedicate activities to Maintenance during Interludes, the GM should reduce the Resupply Cost of maintaining the ship by 2.\n\nRedundant Hull (Double)\nA double hull provides a redundant barrier against the vacuum—usually by a few to several feet—in case the outer hull is damaged. This is standard on most Martian military ships. The ship can ignore the f irst loss condition imposed in an encounter. See Losses in the Spaceships chapter of The Expanse RPG.\n\nRedundant Hull (Triple)\nFor maximum redundancy, the ship has a triple hull design. Less common than the Double Hull, this is primarily a feature of the yachts of the obscenely wealthy. The ship can ignore the first two loss conditions imposed in an encounter. See Losses under Space Combat in the Spaceships chapter of The Expanse RPG.\n\nRepair Facilities\nThe ship has built-in facilities that can repair damage taken to other ships. Most standard losses can be repaired by a ship with repair facilities. To be able to repair serious losses, the ship must also have the Hanger Bay Quality and the ship to be repaired must be able to fit into the hanger bay.\n\nSecurity Systems, Advanced\nThe ship’s security systems and associated software are technologically advanced, providing a +1 bonus to crew Security or Technology tests involving the ship. Additional applications of this quality provide the crew with an additional +1 bonus per option, to a maximum of +5.\n\nSelf-destruct system\nProgrammed to drop the containment on the ship’s fusion reactor. Countdown or a dead-man’s switch\n\nSensor Scrambling\nWhen an enemy is within Medium or closer range, they suffer -1 to all Sensors tests.\n\nStealth\nWhile the ship is at rest, with its drive inactive and using only passive sensors, it is effectively invisible and undetectable to ship sensors.\n\nStealth, Improved\nProtogen stealth technology is more advanced than anything currently used by the UNN and the MCRN. Not only is this ship completely invisible to sensors when its engines are shut off, but heat sinks and other advanced technology make this ship harder to target, giving all enemy ships a -2 to all Electronic Warfare tests.\n\nSturdy\nThe ship is well built and can take more damage than expected for a ship of its size. The Hull receives a +2 to its value: for example, a Sturdy Large frigate would have a Hull score of 2d6+2 rather than the usual 2d6. A ship must be designed and built to have this capability. It cannot be added later.\n\nTargeting Systems, Advanced\nThe ship has a +1 bonus to the Sensors score for Electronic Warfare tests.\n\nUltraluxury Amenities\nThe ship is an ultraluxury vessel with accommodations that would not be out of place in any seven-star resort—full decks given over to sumptuously decorated quarters with staffed galleys, private baths, and lounges—all the best money can buy. And it does cost money: this quality adds +4 to the Resupply Cost to maintain the ship (see the Resupply Cost table in Chapter 1 of this book). The crew can eliminate the increase to Cost by losing this quality, but the ship will not function as it is meant to; it would be somewhat like trying to run a fancy hotel without a staff.\n\nWeapons - PBCs\nOne quality -&gt; cover to forward arcTwo qualities -&gt; full coverage\n\nWeapons - Rail Gun\nMust be at least Medium-sizedSpinal-mounted -&gt; forward or rear firing positionLarge or larger ships -&gt; two rail guns (one in each direction)Gigantic or larger ship -&gt; rail guns on turrets half-spherical range of fire on one side of the ship.\n\nWeapons - Torpedo Launcher\nMedium-sized -&gt; 1 torpedo launcherAdditional Size category -&gt; adds capacity for one launcher\n\nFlaws\n\nFlaw\nEffect\n\nAging\nThe ship is still in good shape but getting older, so it requires extra work to keep flying at its best. The GM should require additional Maintenance, Researching, and/or Fixing activities during Interludes (see Interludes in Chapter 5: Game Play of The Expanse RPG) and increase the Resupply Cost of by +1 to represent the additional mate rials needed for minor upkeep and repairs.\n\nBad Juice\n–1 penalty to Constitution tests involving acceleration hazards.\n\nBanned from Port\nThe ship has been banned from a major port for some reason—warranted or unwarranted. It could be due to substandard maintenance, disturbing the peace, or worse. This flaw should be paired with a specific port in Sol System and can be picked up during gameplay at GM’s discretion.\n\nFaulty System\nThe first use of the system in an encounter roll a die: - 1 or 2 -&gt; system stops working, just like a loss due to damage.\n\nFragile\nReduce its Hull score to that of the Size category one below the ship’s Size.\n\nHigh Maintenance\nRequire additional Maintenance activities and increase the Lifestyle Cost of maintaining the ship by +1.\n\nLimited Range\nThe ships does not carry enough reaction mass for long distance travel using its Epstein drive. Such ships usually have a range of about 1 AU (the distance of earth to the Sun or, roughly, earth to Mars and back).\n\nLumbering\nConsidered one Size category larger for manoeuvring tests.\n\nOld\nThe ship is old—between fifty years and a century’s service in space—and nothing works like it did when it was brand new. The GM should require additional Maintenance, Researching, and Fixing activities during Interludes (see Interludes in Chapter 5: Game Play of The Expanse RPG) and increase the Resupply Cost of by +2 to represent the additional materials needed for minor upkeep and repairs\n\nPoor Acceleration\nThe ship does not accelerate as fast as others of its Size. When performing a high-g manoeuvre, the ship can only add a bonus up to +5 (rather than the usual +6). The ship also suffers a -1 to the Piloting test when attempting to increase or decrease range. This Flaw can be taken up to six times, making the high-g manoeuvre bonus 0 and applying a -6 penalty to Piloting tests when attempting to increase or decrease range.\n\nPoor Amenities\nRecovering activities on board take 50% longer.\n\nSoftware Glitch\nThe ship has a glitch in the software that has been missed by updates and system scans, making it vulnerable to hacking. It is at a -1 penalty in all opposed Electronic Warfare tests (see Space Combat in the Spaceships chapter of The Expanse RPG for details)\n\nThrusters Only\nThe ship is only intended for short trips between planet and moon or station to station and not equipped with an Epstein drive. It limits the ship’s speed to up to 1 g until otherwise modified and takes a considerable amount of time to get up to this speed.\n\nUncomfortable\nCrewmembers find the ship’s space, furniture, and facilities inconvenient to use due to size constraints. Either these are too small, in the case of a pre-Belter era design, or too large, in the case of being designed specifically for Belters only, for some members of the crew. For applicable crewmembers, this will create a -1 penalty to all ship-related actions\n\nVulnerable Systems\nWhen the ship takes losses, choose an additional loss condition\n\nVulnerability\nThe ship has a weakness in the exterior (hull, hangar, cargo bay, etc.) that could be breached for boarding or worse. Anyone scanning the ship can make a TN 13 Intelligence (Technology) test to detect the weakness. Targeted weapon attacks that aim for the weakness impose a impose a -1 penalty to absorbing the Hull damage from that attack.\n\nWanted\nCan cause problems docking at legitimate ports, or might mean the ship needs to avoid certain places or routes in order to avoid further trouble.\n\nWeak Hull\nThe ship has a -1 penalty when determining the Hull total against damage. A ship can have this flaw multiple times, up a maximum equal to its Hull score in dice. For example, if the Hull is 3d6 the flaw can be taken three times.\n\nMaintenance and Upkeep\nGM should take the crew’s need to maintain their ship into account for maintenance activities during interludes, and remind players that neglecting these responsibilities may lead to the ship developing flaws or even suffering some losses, as if it were damaged.",

If you fail an Intelligence (Research) test, you can re-roll it, but must keep the result of the second roll.\n\nExpert\nYou have become adept at recalling relevant information. When you perform the A-Ha! stunt, you gain one free extra use of it; that is, if you spend 1 SP, you can perform the stunt twice, if you spend 2 SP, you can use it three times, and so on.\n\nMaster\nYour fact-finding abilities are unparalleled. When you make an Intelligence (Research) test as part of an advanced test, you gain a +1 bonus to the result of each Drama Die. This increases your total roll, and allows you to reach the success threshold faster.\n\nAce\nFew can fly like you do.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nDexterity 3 or higher and the Dexterity (Piloting) focus.\n\nNovice\nYou can coax more out of your ship than most. When you perform the Punch It chase stunt, you gain an extra +1 bonus on your next chase test, above the bonus gained for the stunt (so the bonus is +2 when you spend 1 SP, +3 when you spend 2 SP and so on).\n\nExpert\nAdd +2 to the Drama Die when making tests using the Dexterity (Piloting) focus.\n\nMaster\nYou are a peerless pilot. Add +1 to tests made using Dexterity (Piloting) and you may re-roll a failed test, although you don’t get the bonus on the re-roll and must take the result of the second roll.\n\nAgent\nYou’re a skilled spy and infiltrator.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nPerception 2 or higher and the Perception (Empathy) and Communication (Deception) focuses.\n\nNovice\nYou built your life on lies. If you fail a Communication (Deception) test, you can re-roll it, but must keep the result of the second roll.\n\nExpert\nYou are also adept at seeing through deception. When you use the Read the Room stunt, add +3 to your Perception (Empathy) roll when the stunt is opposed.\n\nMaster\nYou are a masterful spy. You gain two of the following focuses if you don’t have them already: Communication (Disguise), Communication (Investigation), Dexterity (Stealth), Intelligence (Cryptography), and Intelligence (Security). If you already have all of these, pick two and add +1 to all rolls made using them.\n\nBounty Hunter\nYou know how to find the right jobs, how to track down your target and get the job done with a minimum of fuss, and how to ensure you get paid before moving on to the next bounty.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nPerception 2 or higher and at least one Perception focus.\n\nNovice\nYou can designate someone or something as your “quarry” after spending at least an hour on the job investigating them, including reading a prepared brief or dossier. You can only have one active quarry at a time but can substitute a new quarry for a previous one with an additional time investment. Usually, your quarry is the focus of the bounty you’re currently pursuing. You’re considered to always have the tangential focus necessary to investigate your quarry, and if you have the primary or tangential focus, you gain a +1 bonus on your tests to investigate them. You also gain the benefits of the Dexterity (Initiative) and Perception (Intuition) focuses\n\nExpert\nYou can prepare a major action in relation to your quarry. Whenever you roll initiative against your quarry, you can perform your prepared action first before your quarry acts regardless of the initiative order; you then take your normal actions on your turn. Prepared actions may include things like a Run or Charge towards your quarry, an Attack against them, and attempt to hide from them, or a Stunt Attack directed at them. You can choose your prepared action up to when initiative is rolled. Once action time begins, however, it can’t be changed; you can either take the prepared action or choose not to—if circumstances allow.\n\nMaster\nWhen you surprise your quarry, you are automatically considered to have them dead-to-rights. You have a +2 bonus for any tests to see if you surprise your quarry. This is in addition to any bonuses from ability focuses or your Novice ability for this specialization. Also, if you fail an ability test to unlock a clue related to your quarry, you can re-roll the test and use the result of the second roll instead\n\nCommando\nYou are trained to fight, and to win, no matter the odds.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nConstitution 2 or higher and the Willpower (Self-Discipline) focus.\n\nNovice\nIf you fail a Constitution or Willpower (Self Discipline) test, you can re-roll, but must keep the result of the second roll.\n\nExpert\nYou know how to work with a team to get things done. At this degree, you gain an intensity 1 Relationship with your team, whoever that may be, and you keep the relationship even if the membership of your team changes. You can increase the intensity of this Relationship normally. See the Rewards chapter for details on Relationships.\n\nMaster\nYou can overcome the effects of some conditions through sheer grit. When you acquire the exhausted, fatigued, injured, or wounded conditions, make a TN 13 Constitution (Stamina) or Willpower (Self Discipline) test; if you succeed, you ignore the effects of the condition for the remainder of the encounter, although the condition itself remains.\n\nEntertainer\nIn a solar system containing billions of people, it’s possible for your voice to rise above the crowd—but what will you have to say if it does?\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nFocus in your area of influence with Attribute of 2 or higher\n\nNovice\nYou’ve got some raw potential, and you’re starting to learn how to experiment with it. Sometimes that blows up in your face, but sometimes it finds brilliance in what was otherwise an average work of art. Whenever you roll a test to create or perform art, you may choose to re-roll the attempt but must keep the new roll even if it’s worse. In addition, you should explain how a success transforms a performance that wasn’t going well or how a failure results in a promising piece going off the rails.\n\nExpert\nYou have developed a signature style, possibly even a signature piece such as a custom instrument or beloved persona, and it’s something with which audiences strongly connect. Talk to the GM to develop a clear idea of what this entails, but it should be fairly narrow— “making music” is not a valid signature since it could apply to almost any test for a musician, but “playing daggri-punk” or “my drag persona Miss Fifi Fofum” would both be acceptable since they are specific as to when they apply. Whenever you create using your signature, you can choose to either gain a +2 on the subsequent Income test or reduce the cost of Stunts while using it by 1 SP (minimum 1).\n\nMaster\nYour art is a part of you, and even those who aren’t familiar with your medium can tell right away that you have a gift for it. You make the most challenging artistic feats look easy and attempt things other artists can’t even dream of doing. Reduce the Test Difficulty by one category for all tests related to artistic creation and performance or by two categories if you can feature your signature. In addition, if the Drama Die is lower than 3 on a performance roll related to your art, treat it as though you rolled a 3 in terms of degrees of success. This can be further modified with the Right in the Feels Stunt.\n\nExecutive\nYou claim authority and leadership in an organization.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nCommunication 2 or higher and the Communication (Persuasion) focus.\n\nNovice\nYou have experience in negotiating the byways of your organization. You acquire a Membership in a new organization or advance to the next rank with an existing Membership (see the Rewards chapter for details on Memberships). You can re-roll any test to access privileges from, or influence members of, the organization behind this acquired or improved Member ship, but must keep the results of the second roll.\n\nExpert\nYour authority extends to calling in a subordinate to support you. Once per day you may make a Communication (Persuasion) test. If you succeed, you can call in a subordinate from the organization you chose at the Novice rank to aid you. Use one of the profiles found in the Threats chapter. If your character is level 5-8, this subordinate can be no more than a Minor threat, called at a test TN of 11. If your character is level 9-12, you may choose a Moderate-threat subordinate instead, at a test TN of 13. If your character is level 13 or above, you have the option of a subordinate who’s a Major threat in their own right, if you succeed at a TN 15 test. You do not gain the novice re-roll benefit on this test.\n\nMaster\nBecause you have influence in your organization, you have constant access to resources. Add your Membership rank in the organization to your Income whenever you can call upon your organization. Further more, if your Income score decreases, you regain the lost point during the next interlude when you interact with the organization.\n\nGunfighter\nNo one shoots as quickly or as accurately as you.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nDexterity 2 and Accuracy 2 or higher.\n\nNovice\nYour accuracy is instinctive. Pick Accuracy (Pistols) or Accuracy (Rifles). You gain a +1 to attack and damage rolls for attacks made using your chosen focus.\n\nExpert\nYou’re fast and precise. You may pick the other focus from the Novice degree and apply the Novice benefit to it, or improve the bonus for the focus you picked at Novice rank to +2 to your attack and damage rolls.\n\nMaster\nYou’re one with the gun. Choose one of the following stunts: Lightning Attack, Overwatch, Lethal Blow, or Wound. You can perform the chosen stunt for 1 SP less than usual when wielding a firearm. In the case of Overwatch, spending 1 SP gives you the effects of spending 2 SP, and spending 2 SP gives you the 3 SP effect. See Chapter 5 for details on these stunts.\n\nHacker\nYou excel at the use and abuse of computer systems.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nIntelligence 2 or higher and the Intelligence (Technology) focus.\n\nNovice\nYou are skilled in navigating computer systems. Add +1 to Intelligence (Technology) tests.\n\nExpert\nWhen things go wrong or don’t work quite how you want them to, you’re skilled in finding backdoors and loopholes. You can perform the High Tech Hustle stunt for 2 SP. In advanced tests involving computer systems, add +1 to your Drama Die roll. This increases your total test result and allows you to complete advanced tests faster.\n\nMaster\nBreaking into a system is one thing, but getting in and then out without getting caught is another. While using a computer system, you may perform the Cover Your Tracks stunt for 1 SP. Add another +1 to your Drama Die result while performing advanced tests for a total of +2, otherwise the same as the Expert degree benefit.\n\nInvestigator\nYou’re a skilled detective.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nPerception and Intelligence 2 or higher and least one Perception focus.\n\nNovice\nYou can always make a test to unlock a lead, even if you don’t have a primary or tangential focus relevant to the investigation, although you take a +2 increase in TN when you don’t have either (see Investigation in Chapter 5 for details). If you do have a primary or tangential focus for the lead, you get a +1 bonus to the test with a primary focus (in addition to the focus bonus) and no increase in TN for using a tangential focus.\n\nExpert\nThe real trick to being a great investigator isn’t finding clues, it’s knowing how to use them. You may use the Intuition stunt for 1 SP. Furthermore, if you have the primary focus required to unlock a lead, add another +1 to your roll to do so for a total of +2.\n\nMaster\nWhen all the evidence is gathered, you only need a flash of inspiration to put it together and find the solution. You can use the Breakthrough stunt on an investigation for only 3 SP.\n\nJournalist\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nBased on the type of journalism the character practices, they need either Communication 2 or higher and the Communication (Research) or Communication (Expression) focus, or Intelligence 2 or higher and the Intelligence (Research) or Intelligence (Current Affairs) focus. The GM has the final word on which requirement potentially applies\n\nNovice\nYou’ve learned to use your status as a journalist to get your foot in the door both literally and figuratively. Whenever you use the Press Pass stunt success fully to gain access to a situation, gain +2 to your next social test directly related to conducting journalistic activity.\n\nExpert\nYou’ve developed a few specific techniques as part of your journalistic arsenal. Select three stunts from the General Social Stunts list in The Expanse RPG— halve the SP cost of these stunts, rounded up (minimum 1). This reduction only applies when you’re using a stunt as part of your journalistic work; while they’re encouraged to give it a fair amount of latitude, the GM has the final say on whether it applies to a particular situation.\n\nMaster\nYou’ve got a knack for finding the right angle to make a story catch on and have developed enough of an audience following to get it started. Once per session, you may use the Go Viral stunt for free, provided you have some way of broadcasting the relevant events.\n\nMartial Artist\nYou are a master of hand-to-hand combat.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nFighting 2 or better and at least Novice rank in one hand-to-hand combat style\n\nNovice\nWhen you make a Fighting-based attack roll, add +1 to damage on a successful hit.\n\nExpert\nYou have excellent speed and timing. When you perform the Momentum stunt with SP gained from a Fighting attack roll, you gain a bonus to your initiative as if you spent one more SP than you have. So, if you spend 1 SP, you gain a +6 bonus to initiative; if you spend 2 SP, you gain a bonus of +9.\n\nMaster\nYou are a master of many close combat techniques. When you perform the Stunt Attack action with a Fighting attack roll, you automatically generate 2 SP.\n\nMechanic\nShe takes of you, you take care of her. You are at one with your ship in a way that makes other feel uncomfortable.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nIntelligence 2 or higher and Engineering Focus\n\nNovice\nNominate a ship as &quot;Your Ship&quot;. You have the Intuition focus, for the purposes of identifying if anything is wrong with your ship.\n\nExpert\nYou have worked on so many different systems, that you intuitively know how they work. Your Intuition focus can extend to any mechanical system.\n\nMaster\nRedundancy is the key. You have added extra redundancies to all of your ship's systems. When applying loss conditions from space combat, a roll of on the normal loss table, results in no loss rather than a reroll.\n\nPirate\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nCommunication 2 or higher.\n\nNovice\nYour past deeds have become known and your symbols, be they flags, songs, or catchphrases, herald your impending approach. You gain the Intimidation focus and can use your Communication rather than Strength Ability for tests that use it.\n\nExpert\nYour name is recognized in the far corners of the system and beyond the Ring gate. While people may not always fear you, they certainly respect you both as a celebrity and a known criminal. You gain +2 to all tests to identify prize ships in social situations and +2 to recruit new crew members.\n\nMaster\nWhether through economic disruption, tales of your derring-do, or by atrocities you’ve committed, it’s hard to go anywhere you aren’t known. While it’s harder to keep a low profile, there are distinct financial benefits to your notoriety. You gain a +2 to all tests to sell stolen cargo.\n\nScout\nYou’re skilled at understanding an area of space and finding what you’re looking for.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nIntelligence 2 or higher and the Intelligence (Navigation) focus.\n\nNovice\nYou are adept at making the most of your instruments when looking for something. If you fail an Intelligence (Technology) test when using sensors, you can re-roll it but must keep the result of the second roll.\n\nExpert\nYour astronomical abilities are unrivalled. When you make an Intelligence (Navigation) test as part of an advanced test, you gain a +1 bonus to the result of each Drama Die. This increases your total roll and allows you to reach the success threshold faster.\n\nMaster\nWhen you perform tests using ship sensors, treat them as if their Sensors rating is 1 higher.\n\nSniper\nYou are a crack shot.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nAccuracy 3 or better and the Accuracy (Rifles) focus.\n\nNovice\nYou know how to quietly set up a decisive shot. If you’re hidden from your target, you can re-roll your first Accuracy (Rifles) attack during an encounter, but must keep the results of the second roll.\n\nExpert\nYou know how to wait for a perfect shot to present itself. If you use the Aim action for an Accuracy (Rifles) attack, add a bonus to damage equal to the attack roll bonus your Aim provides. This includes any bonus from the Precision Marksmanship stunt.\n\nMaster\nYou are a deadly shot. When you are using the Accuracy (Rifles) focus, you can perform the Called Shot stunt for 2 SP.\n\nSmuggler\nYou move secret, illegal, illicit, or profitable cargo across contested or monitored borders.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nCommunication 2 or higher and the Communication (Bargaining) focus.\n\nNovice\nYou know how to mitigate risks and maximize profits. Add +1 to all tests where the TN was increased by Risk.\n\nExpert\nWhenever you acquire cargo, whether by using the Merchants Buying rules in Sol System or by using the clients in Trades of the Expanse: Trader/Smuggler, you may choose to also take on a small amount of illicit cargo. Your overall flight gains +1 Risk, but if you complete the trade successfully you gain an additional +2 Temporary Income bonus.\n\nMaster\nWhen you attempt to bribe somebody with an Income test or a Communication (Bargaining) test, you may spend one Temporary Income to re-roll it, but must keep the result of the second roll\n\nSocialite\nYou know people, and how to get what you want from them.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nCommunication and Perception 2 or higher.\n\nNovice\nYour natural charm causes people to like you. You may perform the On the Fence stunt for 1 SP.\n\nExpert\nWhen you attempt a detailed social maneuverer (see Chapter 5: Game Play), you require one fewer shift (to a minimum of 1) to succeed. If the situation only requires a simple social maneuverer, add +1 to your roll.\n\nMaster\nWherever you go, you fit in with ease. When you interact with people who would have an attitude of Neutral or worse toward you, they automatically shift it one step in your favour. This benefit disappears if subjects feel physically threatened by you or your allies, however.\n\nStar\nYou can sway people with your performance, personal charisma, and fame.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nCommunication 2 or higher and the Communication (Performing) focus.\n\nNovice\nWhen using the Communication (Performing) focus, you may perform the Sway the Crowd stunt for 1 SP.\n\nExpert\nA good performance opens doors, and makes people want to know you. You can perform the Oozing Confidence stunt for 2 SP.\n\nMaster\nWhen you need to, you can pull out all of the stops with a performance. When you attempt a social grand gesture (see Chapter 5: Game Play), your success threshold for each shift is one less than it would normally be.\n\nThief\nYou are adept at stealing things and avoiding getting caught.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nDexterity 2 or higher and the Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) and Dexterity (Stealth) focuses.\n\nNovice\nThe first thing a skilled thief perfects is the ability to work unnoticed. You add +1 to all tests made with the Dexterity (Stealth) or the Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) focuses. Choose which focus receives this benefit when you attain this degree.\n\nExpert\nWhen you make a Dexterity test to hide or steal an object, you can re-roll the test if you choose, but must keep the result of the second roll. You become an expert in avoiding suspicion. You may perform the It Wasn’t Me stunt for 2 SP.\n\nMaster\nAdd another +1 to tests using either Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or Dexterity (Stealth), selecting the focus when you attain this degree.\n\nTrader\nYou get things and people where they need to go, and you make a profit while doing so.\n\nCategory\nDetail\n\nRequirement\nIntelligence 2 or higher and the Intelligence (Business) focus.\n\nNovice\nYou’re good at reading people, and you’re excellent at understanding trends. Add +1 to Perception (Intuition) tests.\n\nExpert\nYou’re savvy when it comes to finances, loop holes, and opportunities.
