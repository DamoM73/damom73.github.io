		"content": "A Campaign for The Expanse RPG\n“The Belt bleeds, and the Inners sip champagne on Titan.”\nSix months have passed since Eros burned across the system and plunged into Venus. The stars haven’t looked right since.\nThe UN and the MCRN point guns at each other while retreating from their outposts in the Belt, leaving behind a power vacuum—and an opportunity. On Ceres, Anderson Dawes is calling for Belters to stand for themselves, to protect their own from pirates, criminals, and the vultures that circle in corporate suits.\nYou are a crew of freelancers, survivors, and exiles drawn into a fragile alliance under Dawes’ watchful eye. You’ve been asked to do what the Inners never would: look after your own. Enforce justice in a place where the laws are written in dust. You’ll root out smugglers, uncover hidden agendas, and tangle with black-budget ghosts that should have stayed buried.\nAnd somewhere in the dark, something is stirring—something colder than vacuum, and older than Mars.\nThis is Diomedes’ Spear—a story of loyalty, betrayal, and survival in a solar system coming apart at the seams.\nBuckle in, tolowda. Time to choose who you bleed for.",
